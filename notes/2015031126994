notes
Radar, radio, and optical observations of natural and HF enhancements (ion-acoustic, Langmuir, 
gyro line, radio, and optical) preferably conducted during satellite passes. ISR data will be 
recorded using VHF vertical and UHF vertical or field-aligned mostly simultaneously, using both IL 
and PL channels on both antennas.  Radio emission data will be recorded using a wide-band (0-10 
MHz) receiver provided by Interamerican University and Dartmouth College operating at the 
Auroral Observatory.  Optical data will be recorded by collaborating instruments.  HF radar data 
will be provided by SuperDARN. 

Cassiope/ePOP passes will occur during the middle of the 2100-2330 UT requested observation 
periods as follows: 
10-Mar-2015 224908 UT (best)
11-Mar-2015 223823 UT (best)
12-Mar-2015 222735 UT

For completeness note there is a similar Cassiope/ePOP pass on 9 March:
09-Mar-2015 225949 UT
