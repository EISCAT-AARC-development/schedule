notes
We conduct the generalized auroral tomography observation 
using ALIS,  FMI imagers, NIPR imagers, and the EISCAT radar 
again this year.

The observation mode for each instrument that we plan is almost 
the same as that of last year:
- EISCAT radar: Meridian scan mode from 56 to 80 degrees elevation 
angle during a period of 30sec.
- ALIS: EISCAT south mode. 428nm for active aurora and 558nm for 
weak aurora.
- FMI and NIPR imagers: 428nm for the EMCCD imagers.
