notes
During November, the Cluster orbit is evolving away from the Sun-Earth line, 
toward the dusk flank.  The intervals which Jackie and I identified are three 
flank-skimming or boundary crossing intervals when the footprint of the Cluster 
centroid is magnetically conjugate to EISCAT, as follows:

November 13th  08-12 UT
November 20th  08-12 UT
November 27th  08-12 UT

Since the interval on the 20th falls within an EISCAT CP (CP1/CP6) using the 
mainland ESR and UHF, we considered the possibility to request only the VHF in 
that interval (requesting VHF+ESR on the 13th and 27th).  

We also considered requesting coverage for the cusp-sector perigee pass of 
November 24th (04-08 UT).

VHF should use tau1 at 30 degs elevation along boresight.  ESR should use 
steffe (tau0 is also acceptable) alternating dumps between the 32 and 42m 
dishes.  The default is to use LowElNorth on the 32m dish, though a southward-
looking mode could be used if the Tromso data are too poor to give range 
coverage as far as Svalbard.
