notes
I'd like to be scheduled as late as possible without disturbing the planned 
testing for the mainland radars in week 34 (according to Jussi) 
Exact day is not critical, but I'd really like time of day preserved more or less. 
 
Plasma3 is preliminary -- exactly what gets run depends on what Jussi and myself 
can come up with in the meantime. 
 
 
If EISCAT would like to contribute some of the hours, feel free :-)
