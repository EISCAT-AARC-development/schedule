notes
We conduct observations of Medium-Scale Traveling Ionospheric Disturbances
(MSTID) using the EISCAT UHF and VHF radars and European GPS networks. Antenna
directions of the UHF and VHF radars are along the magnetic field line and
vertical, respectively.
It is preferable to run the observations under quiet geomagnetic condition.
