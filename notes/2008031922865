notes
This is a block booking for an extended period of passive IPS observations, 
required in support of the Whole Heliosphere Interval (WHI), which is part of 
the International Heliophysical Year.

EISCAT will not be used continuously, but will observe a few sources each day 
using different combinations of radars.  

The overall observing schedule for the EISCAT IPS observations is at:
