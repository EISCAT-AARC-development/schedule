notes
This is a Plasma Line Auroral Ring (PLAR) experiment which requires 
simultaneous Heater, UHF and CUTLASS radar operation. The super-Heater will be 
pointed 9 deg. South at 5.423 MHz. Depending on the ionosphere, the pump 
frequency should be just above the gyroharmonic. This has previously produced 
an artificial optical ring. The UHF will scan in 1 deg. steps either 
north-south or east-west in order to confirm the ring-like structure at radar 
wavelengths. TAU2-PL will be run to be sensitive to Langmuir turbulence. The 
CUTLASS radar is sensitive to upper-hybrid resonance.
