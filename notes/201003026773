notes
We plan to continue a study of HF heater-induced phenomena in the ionospheric
F-region, including:(a)the saturation and hysteresis effects in electron 
temperatures and intensity of AFAIs under power stepping; (b)phenomena in 
under dense ionospheric plasma due to HF pumping with X-polarisation; (c)
heater-induced phenomena above Tromso from DEMETER satellite observations. 
Experiments will be carried out from 2 March to 8 March every day from 12 to 
17 UT by using the HF heating facility (HEA) and Tromso UHF radar (TRO). The 
experiments to be cancelled due to unsuitable ionospheric conditions or can be 
moved on earlier or later hours from 12 and 17 UT.
