notes
We aim to visualize the 2D fine-scale electric field/current 
structure in the vicinity of a type of morning-side polar cap 
arc that propagates poleward very rapidly. For this purpose, 
we plan to operate the 42m and 32m dishes simultaneously with 
"best-efforts" temporal resolutions. We prefer good weather 
conditions for possible comparison with the simultaneously 
operating optical instruments at KHO. But we do not always need 
magnetically disturbed conditions because the type of polar cap 
arc is generally a phenomenon during quiet period.
