notes
This experiment aims at study of tidal and planetary waves in the lower themosphere.
We like to extend CP-2 run to 8-days window, with which  we can work on
tidal variability as well as Q2DW.
Scientis from 4 countries are involved.  
In case some ploblems happen in the beggning of the CP-2 run on November 11, we like 
to extend our run so that 8 days of data window can be achieved.

This ESR run couples with the KST run.
Total resources are as follows:
Ni(36), SW(24), NO(24),GE(12 for KST and 36 for ESR).

Then we divide the resources into two (for KST and ESR) as follows:
KST: NI(18), SW(18), NO(18), GE(12)
ESR:NI(18),SW(6),NO(6),GE(36)
