notes
This EISCAT experiment covers Swarm A and C (C in brackets) passing first over
ESR at 21:56 UT, elevation 88 (83) deg and then over Tromssa at 21:58 UT,
elevation 78 (72) deg.

We request simultaneous measurements by ESR (42m + 32m low elevation south), UHF
(field-aligned) and VHF (vertical, tri-static).

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Three Swarm satellites (A, B and C) perform high precision magnetic field
measurements using both vector and scalar magnetometers. The electric field
instrumentation (EFI) includes a thermal ion imager (TII) and Langmuir probe
(LP). The EFI PI is David Knudsen <knudsen@ucalgary.ca> from the University of
Calgary. For LP contact Stephan Buchert <scb@irfu.se>. Using EFI data electron
density and temperature, ion drift vector and temperature and the perpendicular
electric field can be derived. In addition accelerometer instruments, onboard
GPS receivers and ground-based laser ranging of Swarm support a very precise 
orbit determination.
