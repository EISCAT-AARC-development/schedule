notes
This request is being submitted to add 36 UK hours to the NEMI campaign. These 
hours will be used to make all the UHF observations tristatic (the earlier 
request was for Tromso only).  The experiment will also be extended, so that it 
begins at 18 UT on every day from February 2nd to 9th. The original request was 
for observations to begin at 19 UT. In return, some of the runs will use the 
UK's choice of tristatic position (above the UCL FPI at Kiruna).
