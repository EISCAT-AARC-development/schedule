notes
This experiment is intended to provide radar support for the new Svalbard 
Scanning Doppler Imager (SCANDI) instrument belonging to UCL, which is now 
installed in the Adventdalen observatory.

These experiments will use the standard ESR CP2.  Clear conditions are 
required, hence three runs have been requested to allow some flexibility - it 
is intended to run these experiments on two nights.

The requested slot runs from 19 to 05 UT on each of three nights (Feb 26/27, 
27/28 and 28/March 1st) coinciding with the SPEAR campaign and immediately 
preceding the long IPY run.
