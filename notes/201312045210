notes
ASK-EASI

The aims of this experiment which require the use of the EISCAT Svalbard Radar are:-
   - to study the occurrence and spatial distribution of NEIALs using
interferometry techniques
   - to study the energy distribution within and surrounding narrow auroral
forms (especially when associated with NEIALs),
   - and apply the results to theories of NEIAL occurrence and production, and
in general to theories of auroral acceleration processes.

In addition to the ESR, the EASI interferometer and the Auroral Structure and
Kinetics instrument (ASK) will be operated concurrently. The radar observations
should be made in a field aligned mode and raw data must be saved.

The experiment is part of a collaboration between UK, 12 hours, Norway, 20
hours, and Sweden, 30 hours, for a total of 62 hours.
