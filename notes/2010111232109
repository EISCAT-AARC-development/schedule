notes
We plan to investigate contrasting O/X-mode heating effects in the ionospheric
F-region in the magnetic zenith. Behavior of artificial field-aligned 
irregularities, electron density and electron temperature in underdense 
ionospheric plasma due to HF pumping with X-polarisation will be studied.  
Experiments will be carried out from 4 November to 12 November every day from 
12 to 17 UT by using the HF heating facility (HEA) and Tromso UHF radar (TRO). 
The experiments to be cancelled due to unsuitable ionospheric conditions or 
can be moved on earlier or later hours from 12 and 17 UT.
