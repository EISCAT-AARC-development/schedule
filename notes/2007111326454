notes
At the moment (June 2007) I am just entering a placeholder request for this 
period.  The details of what experiments will be run can be decided near the 
time.

This is the second Earth-flyby of Rosetta, for which it is hoped that a wide-
scale co-ordinated campaign of ground and space-based instruments can be 
organised.  See the message from Steve Milan below:

> Rosetta will make its second Earth flyby on 13 November 2007.  The
> trajectory that the spacecraft will take is very interesting, 
> approaching the Earth from the nightside, flying up the southern lobe 
> of the magnetotail for several hundred Earth radii before exiting 
> near the dayside.  This is an unparalleled opportunity to study the 
> large scale properties and dynamics of the tail.  Of course, Cluster 
> and Themis will also be operational at this time, providing a very 
> comprehensive view of the near-Earth magnetosphere.  I believe that 
> ground-based observations will also be key to understanding the 
> dynamics viewed by Rosetta.  This email is to encourage all 
> ground-based instrumentation to plan for this almost unique 
> conjunction.  For my part I will liaise with the SuperDARN scheduling 
> bodies to ensure that the radars operate in a sensible mode for the 
> duration of the conjunction, that is the 6th to the 13th 
> November.  Could other people let me know if their instrumentation 
> can support this exciting campaign?
