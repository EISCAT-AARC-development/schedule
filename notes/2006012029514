notes
The purpose of this experiment is to measure field-aligned currents (FACs) by a 
number of methods. The tristatic UHF system will be used to obtain measurements 
of the electric field vector at several closely spaced points in order to 
determine its divergence, and so estimate the FACs. Standard programs (for 
example: tau2pl or arc1) will be used, but the experimenters hope to develop an 
optimised program for plasma line measurements in order to estimate the FAC 
along the beam. The measurements will be compared with multi-wavelength optical 
data.
