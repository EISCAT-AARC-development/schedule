notes
The VHF radar will run the standard "manda" program for different pointing
positions such as 90°, 80°, 70°. If PMWE is strong the remote receivers in So
and Ki can be used.

The experiment WILL BE ONLY RUN if conditions are suitable for PMWE, e.g.
electron precipitation to enhance the D-region and/or if PMWE has been observed
in other radars like Esrad and Maarsy.
