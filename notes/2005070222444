notes
The purpose of this experiment is make EISCAT observations of the terrestrial 
effects of coronal holes. A coronal hole is expected to cross the solar 
meridian on 1 July, and the intention is to time the observations to coincide 
with this. The precise time of the crossing is not yet known, and we have 
therefore booked a continuous period of five days. We hope soon, however, to 
refine this to a much shorter period. The experiment will require both the 
Mainland UHF and VHF Radars, and also both of the Svalbard antennas. It is 
hoped to make simultaneous observations of the solar disc using the EIT 
instrument on SOHO.
