notes
SSignatures of propagating AGW were seen sometimes in the ion velocity observed by ESR at low 
elevation to south. Such observations are to be likely during daytime (high enough F-region electron 
density) under quiet geomagnetic condition. At the same time the AGW may be monitored with 
SuperDARN, ionosondes, and optical instruments (in the case of dark sky). 
Secondary purpose (in the case of geomagnetic disturbances) may be studying dayside long-period 
geomagnetic pulsations and traveling convection vortices.
- Radar to be used: ESR, taro, 32m antenna (e.g., 75% power) az=150, el=30; 42m (e.g., 25%) field-
aligned; UT window: 11-19 UT, 3 x 8-h runs
