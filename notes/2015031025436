notes
Radar, radio, and optical observations of natural and HF enhancements (ion-acoustic, Langmuir, 
gyro line, radio, and optical) preferably conducted during satellite passes. ISR data will be 
recorded using VHF vertical and UHF vertical or field-aligned mostly simultaneously, using both IL 
and PL channels on both antennas.  Radio emission data will be recorded using a wide-band (0-10 
MHz) receiver provided by Interamerican University and Dartmouth College operating at the 
Auroral Observatory.  Optical data will be recorded by collaborating instruments.  HF radar data 
will be provided by SuperDARN. 

During 0630-0900 UT on 9, 10, 11, and 12 March we will dovetail with STD, pmwe_swe, and/or 
SP_NI_Ti observations, starting earlier with VHF, UHF, and possibly also HF (Heating).  

Cassiope/ePOP passes will occur during the middle of the requested observation periods as 
follows: 
20150309 075149 UT
20150310 074108 UT (best one)
20150311 073023 UT
20150312 071936 UT
