notes
Detailed investigation of the angular dependence of the magnetic zenith (MZ) 
effect associated with the heating of electrons. See July 2014 for further 
details.

These schedule requests are indicative of the period in which the experiment is 
likely to be run: it is in site working hours and it is assumed that operations 
will be flexible. The site staff will be kept informed of the intention to run. 
Due to the small available resource, there may be only a single 3-hour run.

Quiet geomagnetic conditions are required.
