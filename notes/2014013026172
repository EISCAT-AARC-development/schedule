This experiment focuses on causality to produce hard-particle
precipitation and its effects on the ionosphere and thermosphere after
substorm onset and in pulsating aurora. UHF and VHF collaborate with
optical instruments at the site. Auroral activity in the clear sky is
desirable. VHF keeps looking vertical to measure mainly lower
ionosphere, and UHF covers whole ionosphere.
