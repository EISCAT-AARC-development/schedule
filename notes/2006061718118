notes
VHF: runexp /kst/exp/tau8/tau8 fm lowel AA
UHF: runexp /kst/exp/tau1/tau1 fm cp4 AA

In June, the Cluster orbit is moving towards orthogonality with the Sun-Earth 
line.  However, there are still some magnetopause crossings and we have 
selected two events which are good conjunctions with the ESR shortly before 
magentopause crossings, namely:

June 05 04-09 UT
June 17 04-08 UT

In both cases, the modes should be LowElNorth on the ESR 32m dish with some 
interleaved dumps e.g. 4:1 on the 42m dish, using Steffe.  The VHF should 
observe at 30 degrees elevation looking north along boresight with the tau1 
modulation.
