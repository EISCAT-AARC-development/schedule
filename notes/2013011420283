notes
This is a block booking, to covering a number of possible experiments, for an 
international campaign of radar and optical measurements to be held at the time 
of the January new moon.  The precise modes to be run will depend on activity 
and sky conditions, and may include:

- Field-aligned observations in conjunction with the EASI interferometer and the 
ASK imagers, to study small scale auroral structure.  These measurements will 
include the recording of raw sample-level data.  (Main participants: University 
of Southampton, University of Tromso, KTH Stockholm and SWRI)

- A small scan on the 32m dish (at low speed because of the broken gearbox) 
interleaved with 42m field-aligned observations, to study the response of the 
thermosphere to magnetospheric forcing, including the possibility of 
thermospheric pre-conditioning.  (Main participants: UCL, University of Bergen)

- An experiment in conjunction with GNSS beacon satellites, which can be run if 
conditions are not suitable for optical measurements. (Main participant: 
University of Bergen).

We are requesting the interval from 03-12UT on every day from January 7th to 
14th inclusive.  Earlier or later dates are not useful, due to moonlight.  In 
total this is 8x9 hours = 72 hours, which will be funded by a combination of UK, 
Norwegian and Swedish hours, plus an allocation of peer reviewed time belonging 
to Robert Mitchell (SWRI, United States).

The precise distribution of time among participating countries will be confirmed 
nearer to the time of the campaign, but might be something like UK(44), NO(44), 
PP(24), SW(8).
