notes
This experiment is an investigation into the role of particle precipitation and  
the auroral emissions produced. A particular goal is the identification of the  
role of proton precipitation. The proposed experimental mode is tau0 modulation  
on the Svalbard Fixed Antenna. Observations are to be made in conjunction with   
the UK spectrometer located in Adventdalen. It is expected that there will be simultaneous Mainland observations using Norwegian time. 
 
NB: It became necessary to change our plans, so that there is more than one UK 
booking for this interval. This entry should be one that should stand.
