notes
Three Swarm satellites were launched on November 22, 2013, into polar
orbits. They carry Langmuir probes designed and built by IRF Uppsala and
a new type of thermal ion imagers (TII) by the University of Calgary, PI
David Knudsen. Together the LPs and TIIs form the electric field
instruments (EFIs). From the EFI data electron density and temperature,
ion drift vector and temperature and the electric field are derived,
essentially the same parameters as EISCAT measures (but with very
different spatial coverage and temporal resolutions).

The experiment aims primarily at calibrating/validating the EFI data.
