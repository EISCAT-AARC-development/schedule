notes
The primary purpose of this experiment is to investigate the
altitude-variation of Naturally Enhanced Ion-Acoustic echoes (NEIAL)
with the ESR-radars simultaneously with determining their horizontal
structure with interferometric aperture synthesis imaging with
EASI-measurements. Requirements for the experiments are auroral
activity, and preferably clear skies to ease complementary optical
observations.
