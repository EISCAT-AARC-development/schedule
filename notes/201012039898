notes
PCB experiment is used to study the dynamical features related to the polar cap boundary and convection 
across the boundary. The experiment utilizes both the UHF (tau1) and VHF (tau8v) radars, which are 
pointed at 30 deg elevation but with different azimuths to the north to get the plasma velocity vector. In 
addition, simultaneous ESR32m (low-elevation to north) and 42m antenna measurements are used (taro 
or folke experiment).
