notes
This is an experiment to study thermospheric density variations and upwelling
using the two mainland radars and the ESR to get coverage of the polar cap to
the auroral oval.

Radar observations are required to coincide with optical measurements so clear,
dark skies are needed. Results will be compared with polar cap observations and
feed into modelling studies.

The VHF will be tilted to the north along with the UHF to provide 'beam
swinging' information of Vi vectors. The ESR 32m dish will scan to the south to
provide Vi vectors.
