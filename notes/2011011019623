notes
We aim at investigating variations of ion temperature and electric field in
the F-region (Thermosphere) in order to understand more deeply the basic
state of the Thermosphere as well as the coupling between
Magnetosphere-Ionosphere-Thermosphere in the polar region. We run the Tromso UHF radar and ESR.

concerning ESR operation. we ask a site staff to operate ip3 for us.
