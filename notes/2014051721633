This is a joint UK-Norwegian experiment to provide EISCAT observations in 
support of the  CLUSTER spacecraft as they traverse the southern hemisphere 
cusp. Two intervals have been selected for May 2014, (accounted to the CCOC and 
UK-CSCS allocation) each run lasting four hours (the minimum time for a single 
radar operation).

Although we are requesting 4-hour slots the experiment only really needs about 2
hours. Thus if any other experimenters request overlapping time we could come to 
an agreement to reduce the time that may be charged.

The experiment configuration should be the same as used in the CCOC experiments 
of April and May 2013: 

The VHF will be operated pointing at low elevation to the north 
The UHF will be operated at low elevation pointing generally north-west to
provide wider cusp coverage and 2D velocity estimates in conjunction with the
VHF 
The ESR 32m dish will point at low elevation to the north, interleaved with 
observations on the 42m dish.

This configuration will optimise the chances of observing features in the Cusp
to provide context and interhemispheric comparison with the CLUSTER satellites.
