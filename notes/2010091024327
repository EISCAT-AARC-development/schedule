notes
A heating experiment is designed to detect the temporal and spatial variation 
of pump-induced electron temperature, electron density and ion line power. The 
UHF radar will work in the scan mode to get the spatial distribution of 
heating effects. VHF radar will be used to measure the modulation in D region. 
The UHF and VHF will run a standard code, e.g. beata and manda.
