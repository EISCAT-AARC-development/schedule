notes
April 2008 is the best month for Cluster passes through the dayside cusp, with 
the Cluster orbit plane being close to the Sun-Earth line.  We are requesting 
four intervals, each of which includes a good dayside cusp pass close to 
magnetic conjugacy with EISCAT. The four intervals are:

April 1 06-10  
April 8 07-11  
April 20 06-10
April 27 07-11

For all of these intervals, the best configuration is to run tau1 on the VHF, 
looking north at low (30 degrees) elevation along boresight, and to run tau0 on 
the ESR, using the LowElNorth configuration the 32m dish, with dumps being 
interleaved (4:1) between the 32m and 42m dishes.
