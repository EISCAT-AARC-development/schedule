The objective is to support the “PMWE” sounding rocket campaign, which implies
• First rocket-borne measurements of small-scale structures in neutral gas,
electrons, ions, and MSPs, as well as absolute electron, ion, and MSP-density
measurements inside the PMWE.
• Simultaneous observation of PMWE at 2 different frequencies (53.5 and 224 MHz)
and rocket-borne measurements.
• Analysis of EISCAT PMWE-observations to determine charged aerosol and/or
turbulence parameters aiming at a unique possibility to compare the results with
other measurement techniques (i.e. in situ and MST-radars).
