notes
The project is part of a cooperation between UNIS and Univ Bergen (both part of
the Birkeland Center for Space Science)and a continuation of the NANSEN campaign
run in November 2014. We plan to focus our experiments on the
study of ion outflow in the cusp region. We plan to utilize the ionospheric
profiles derived from the ESR in to compare with previous studies which have
utilized Cluster data. 
The campaign is scheduled to coincide with times when the sun is 8 degrees below
the horizon to allow complimentary measurements from optical instruments at the
Kjell Henriksen Observatory.
We will use the ESR in a field aligned mode using the beata or tau7 experiment
(high altitude measurements). We have over-scheduled experiments with a view to
cancelling if optical conditions are poor or geomagnetic conditions too active.
If optical conditions are unsuitable during all daytime runs then we have
scheduled a nightside run to extend the study to possible ion outflow associated
with nighside auroral processes. 

If no-one is available to travel to Svalbard we request that the engineers on
site run the experiment on our behalf since it will be during normal working
hours (with the exception of the experiment on Tuesday 24th November).  We will
discuss how to provide a person on site for this run.

The runs will also form part of the fieldwork for UNIS course AGF345/845, with
the students able to observe the radar 'in action'.

Collaborators are-
Stein Haaland, Max-Planck Inst & Birkeland Center for Space Science,
Lisa Baddeley, UNIS (& Birkeland Center for Space Science),
