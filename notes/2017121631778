notes
We wil run the EISCAT UHF radar  with the sodium LIDAR and a  5-wavelength 
photometer. Clear sky is desired. Based on the simultaneous data, evaluation of Joule heating and derivation 
of ion-neutral collision frequency will be made. We book 4 nights, but if it would goes very well for the first 
two nights,  we would cancel the others. It depends.
