notes
Measurements around a predicted overpass by Swarm satellites. UHF and VHF at low
elevation northward. 42m field-aligned, 32m either low elevation southward or
along Swarm orbit northward. 1 hour overlap in VHF with Esa Turunen's pulsating
aurora experiment will be resolved during the campaign.
