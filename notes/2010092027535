notes
This experiment will make measurements of ionospheric artificial wave injection 
(0.1-10 Hz) using the EISCAT Heater and UHF radar in conjunction with an 
industrial magnetotelluric surveying magnetometer, the IMAGE fluxgate 
magnetometers, and Finland (Oulu) pulsation magnetometers. 

The plan is to run seven 6-h runs spread over about a week. In each run, the 
heating signal at should be at ~4MHz, with full power and field-aligned X-mode 
polarisation.  The modulation should be as follows:

(i) Heater on for 5 seconds, off for 5 seconds for 5 minutes
(ii) Heater then off for 5 minutes 

The magnetometers are only available for a short period (18-28 September) so the 
campaign has to take place on the dates specified.  The UHF radar will run in a 
simple survey mode to characterise the ionospheric conditions.
