notes
This request is part of the international support for the CAPER and C-REX rocket 
launches. I am scheduling 24 hours of UK mainland time to support this launch, 
but there will certainly be cancellations.  Probably the experiments will only 
actually be run on three days, including the two days on which the rockets are  
launched. Decisions about what mode to run will be made on the day of launch, 
according to weather conditions and launch priorities at Andoya.  Once both 
rockets have been launched, any further bookings will be cancelled.
