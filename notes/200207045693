notes
This experiment was designed to be a joint UHF/ESR study of high-altitude ion temperature anisotropies above Svalbard.  The UHF radar will be used to look above Svalbard, intersecting the field-aligned beam of the 42m dish.  The 32m dish will be used to intersect the UHF beam at a position between Tromso and Svalbard.  The ESR modulation will be tau0, although there may be some use of the "hialt" modulation in collaboration with Anja Stromme and Tony van Eyken.             
Ideally the UHF would use the tau3 modulation scheme.  If this scheme cannot be run because of the recent waveguide-arcing problems, then pia will be used.  If the UHF waveguide problems allow insufficient power to get the necessary range coverage (~1100 km) then subsequent runs will probably be cancelled.
