notes
Observations of electric field and precipitation during a swarm satellite overpass. 

This is a compensation for radar time lost in October due to technical problems
in the VHF. We ask for EISCAT staff to operate the radars for us. 

UHF:
/kst/exp/beata/beata cp1 FI

VHF, KIR, SOD:
/kst/exp/beata/beata zenith FI
