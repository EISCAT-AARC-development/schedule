August sees the beginning of the tail conjunction season, as the Cluster orbit 
moves back towards the noon-midnight plane with Cluster apogee on the 
nightside.  We have selected five events, all in the midnight sector, where 
Cluster has a magnetic conjunction with EISCAT/ESR close to a tail crossing.

Note that the conjunctions generally occur at latitudes between EISCAT and ESR -
 hence a desirable option for this period would be to operate the ESR in 
LowElSouth mode, with the Tromso VHF looking north along boresight as normal.

If the VHF is unavailable due to the planned klystron bakeout, then running 
tau1 on the UHF (az 359.5, el 30) would be a suitable alternative.  If the ESR 
32m dish is unavailable because of the requested dish maintenance then 42m-only 
operations would be better than nothing.

The selected intervals are as follows:

August 1st   2300 - 0300 August 2nd
August 8th   2300 - 0300 August 9th
August 15th  2130 - 0130 August 16th
August 22nd  2200 - 0200 August 23rd
August 27th  2130 - 0130 August 28th
