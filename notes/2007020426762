In February 2007, the alignment of the Cluster orbit is returning toward the 
Sun-Earth line.  Although the orbit configuration is still not optimal for cusp 
crossings, there are a number of dayside magnetopause crossings close to 
magnetic conjugacy with EISCAT, and cusp conjunctions could occur given the 
correct (By) conditions.  We have selected four EISCAT/Cluster conjunctions for 
coverage, as follows:

February  4th 2200 - February  5th 0200 (perigee pass)
February  7th 1400 - February  7th 1800
February 12th 0800 - February 12th 1200
February 26th 1100 - February 26th 1500

The runs on the 4th and 26th do not clash with any other planned EISCAT 
operation and have been requested as joint ESR/VHF.  The runs on the 7th and 
12th clash with a CP2 experiment planned for the ESR, and have hence been 
requested as VHF only.  In addition, a promising conjunction on the 19th has 
not been requested since it conflicts with the EISCAT Annual Review Meeting.
