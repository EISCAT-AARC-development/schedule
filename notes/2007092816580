notes
September is the best month for conjunctions of Cluster with the midnight 
sector magnetotail, as the orbit is aligned close to the Sun-Earth plane.  

Although there are several good conjunctions during the month, one problem is 
that the spacecraft will be subjected to several long eclipses during the 
period from September 12th to 28th and the instruments will be turned off 
during many of the tail conjunctions in this interval.  The requested 
experiments therefore concentrate on conjunctions at the beginning and end of 
the month, which avoid the worst effects of the eclipses on Cluster operations.

Dates and times are as follows:

02/09/2007  2100-0100 (03/09/2007) 

09/09/2007  2030-0030 (10/09/2007) 

14/09/2007  2000-2400 

28/09/2007 1930-2330 

For these experiments, the preferred modes are tau0 LowElSouth on the ESR, with 
dumps interleaved 4:1 between the 32m and 42m dishes, and northward-looking 
tau1 on the VHF with boresight pointing and 30 degrees elevation.
