notes
The aim of our "GNSS-EISCAT Heating Activity (GEISHA) experiment is to study
variations in total electron content obtained from transionospheric GNSS signals
for times, when the signal beam is disturbed by artificial ionospheric heating
(EISCAT). We plan to set up two GPS receiver stations - one at the EISCAT site
and the other TGO. It is planed to heat during geomagnetic quiet times and best
at local dawn or during afternoon daylight conditions and dusk.

The experiment is scheduled for certain days using the EISCAT Heating facility
and the TRO UHF radar. From Dec. 1st - 3rd the requested time is in arrangement
with UK if their conditions are not fulfilled.
