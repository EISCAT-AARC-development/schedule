notes
This EISCAT experiment covers Swarm C and A (values for A in brackets) passing 
over the VHF at 12:13:19(28) UT, h=462 km, range=462.5 km

The Kiruna and Sodankylä receivers should be pointed to the common volume at 462 
km height above the VHF

Another pass by Swarm B occurs at 13:59:07 UT. After 13:30 the Kiruna and 
Sodankylä receivers should be pointed to the common volume at 518 km height 
above the VHF.
==========================================


Three Swarm satellites, A, B, and C, perform high precision magnetic field
measurements using both vector and scalar magnetometers. The
instrumentation includes a thermal ion imager (TII) and Langmuir probe
(LP). Together the LP and TII form the electric field instruments
(EFIs). The PI is David Knudsen <knudsen@ucalgary.ca> from the University of 
Calgary. For LP please contact Stephan Buchert <scb@irfu.se>. Using EFI data 
electron density and temperature, ion drift vector and temperature and the 
perpendicular electric field can be derived. In addition accelerometer 
instruments, onboard GPS receivers and ground-based laser ranging of Swarm 
support a very precise orbit determination.
