notes
We plan to search for enhanced ion acoustic lines at high altitude 
using the eiscat Svalbard radar. Simultaneously, we shall be observing 
auroral emissions with the cameras of the Auroral Large Imaging System 
(alis). In this way we aim at an increased understanding of plasma 
processes taking place in the auroral acceleration region.
