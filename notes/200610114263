CHAMP-cusp (01-14 Oct 2006)
The campaign intends to perform more systematic studies on thermospheric
upwelling within the cusp region during conjunctions of the CHAMP satellite with
the radar ionospheric observation volume. First of all ESR radar will be used,
if available together with VHF looking into about the same volume.
The request is preliminary, and subject to more precise orbit predictions of the
CHAMP satellite about one month prior to the campaign. It is overbooked, i.e.
cancellations will be done, because only nearby (more closer) satellite passages
will be actually used, which are expected about every second day.
