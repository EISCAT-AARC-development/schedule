notes
Detect the temporal and spatial dynamics of pump-induced electron temperature 
enhancements as well as SEE as a function of aspect angle to the magnetic 
field line. The UHF and Heater will be scanned in zenith angle. Quiet 
geophysical conditions are required. Cancellations are anticipated. The UHF-
tristatic will run a standard code, e.g. beata.
