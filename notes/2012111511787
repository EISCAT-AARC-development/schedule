notes
We plan to continue studies of contrasting O/X-mode heating phenomena in the F-
region of the polar ionosphere induced by SPEAR heating facility in the frame 
of UNIS-AARI SPEAR project.  Experiments will be carried out from 12 November 
to 22 November from 09 to 13 UT except for 
17 and 18 November (Saturday and Friday) with using the SPEAR heating facility  
and Svalbard radar (ESR). The experiments to be cancelled due to unsuitable 
ionospheric conditions.
