notes
PI: T. Sakanoi and Y. Otsuka

This is a comparative study of ion up/outflow using the Reimei satellite and
Tromso UHF radar. 

We also conduct observations of Medium-Scale Traveling Ionospheric Disturbances
(MSTID) using the EISCAT UHF and VHF radars and European GPS networks. Antenna
directions of the UHF and VHF radars are along the magnetic field line and
vertical, respectively.
