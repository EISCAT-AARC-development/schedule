notes
The purpose of this experiment is to provide training to students taking the
AGF-304 radar course at UNIS. We plan to use both antennas, and depending on the
geophysical conditions at the time, we will use different pulse codes
(e.g.beata, ipy, tau0 and taro) and a combination of fixed positions, azimuth
and elevation scans.  The students will decide on the operating mode and pulse
code used based on a proposal they have submitted as part of their course. The
data will be used for their project work. We will have optical support from KHO.
