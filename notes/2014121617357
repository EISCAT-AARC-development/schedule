notes
We need astronomical twilight to avoid contamination by Rayleigh scattering of
Sunlight. In December this is not a stringent constraint. The 18h allocated are
splitted into 3 slots of 4h and 2 slots of 3h on 5 consecutive days, from 16 to
20 December. We will arrive in Skibotn observatory on the evening of December
15. There we will run the spectropolarimeter.  Since we also need clear sky, we
may decide to change the schedule the afternoon before depending on the weather
forecast. The radar will be used field-aligned with the BEATA code.
