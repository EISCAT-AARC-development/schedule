notes
The ion-neutral coupling will be studied in the vicinity of auroral structures.
Substorm events are preferred. Electric field will be estimated using VHF
3-static + KAIRA. UHF will be run in CP1 mode. Simultaneously, thermospheric
winds will be measured by the FPI (Nagoya University) at TRO.  No simultaneous
heating.
