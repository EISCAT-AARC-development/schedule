notes
Radar, radio, and optical observations of naturally-enhanced emissions (ion-acoustic, Langmuir, radio, and 
optical waves) conducted near local midnight and/or during satellite passes.  ISR data will be recorded 
using VHF vertical and UHF vertical or field-aligned simultaneously, using both IL and PL channels on both 
antennas.  A new control program will be used for this purpose.  Radio emission data will be recorded 
using a wide-band (0-10 MHz) receiver provided by Interamerican University and Dartmouth College 
operating at the Auroral Observatory.  Optical data will be recorded by collaborating instruments.  HF radar 
data will be provided by SuperDARN.  We are somewhat over-subscribed, certain runs will be cancelled in 
advance, based on predicted conditions.
