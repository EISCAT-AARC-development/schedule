notes
The aims of the experiment using the SPEAR heating facility together with the
EISCAT Svalbard Radar and EISCAT
Aperture Synthesis Imaging (EASI) are:
   - to study heating introduced plasma instabilities in the E-region
   - and the horizontal distribution of modifications introduced by the heater
using radar interferometry.
Pulse code LT4FL and Beata will be run on the Radar.
