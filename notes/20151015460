notes
These measurements are connected to a rocket launch at Esrange, Sweden. While 
this request covers the time period August 10-20, we will only need 
approximatetly half of these days, depending of the exact timing of the rocket 
launch. Cancellation of dates that are not needed will be made at latest on the 
previous working day. 

Measurement hours connected to a first rocket launch during the 
period October 1-5  are requested separately (experiment name OSTATES 1).

A scientific motivation for these EISCAT measurements has been sent to Stephan 
Buchert as Swedish representative.
