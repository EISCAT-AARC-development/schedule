notes
Dec 7th.  On this day, CLUSTER will be somewhere over Russia about 02
UT.  At about 0310 UT it passes just East of Svalbard, then moves into
the polar cap, with the magnetic footprint describing a Descartes folium
which moves back over Svalbard sometime around 1230 UT.  By 1400, the 
footprint will be over Greenland.  CLUSTER crosses out of the magnetopause
by 1700 UT.

We have discussed an experiment which looked North at low
elevation alternating with field aligned measurements.  This might
be the best mode to use during the interval 02-13 UT. After that,
the CLUSTER footprint will move toward the Greenland sector and it might
be more productive to do a windshield-wiper mode looking towards Sondy
(even better if we could get Sondy to do the same thing looking toward
Svalbard).

If we can get supporting CP4 observations from the mainland during this
interval, they would undoubtedly be very useful.
