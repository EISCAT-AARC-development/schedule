notes
there's one other  
interval that I might add, especially if we decide to cancel the runs  
on the 20th and 22nd.  It's the afternoon of the 30th, maybe 12 to  
20 UT - although by now the geometry is not nearly so good for EISCAT  
and in fact Sondy will have the most important role in the tail  
campaign if I understand things correctly.
