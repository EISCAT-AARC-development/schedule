notes
Oct 8 17-19 Nsheet KST ESR 2200-2300 STF          
The footprint passes between 
ESR and KST, moving out westward over Greenland after 20 UT.  In fact 
this geometry is similar to a number of the cases in the following days. 
As pointed out by Hermann, this seems like a good candidate for a  
combined EISCAT/Sondy experiment.  I wonder whether there might be 
some merit in scanning towards Sondy after 20 UT as has been tried 
before?  Also we should consider the position 
of the ESR steerable beam before 20 UT.  Is Northward or Southward 
the best direction ?
