notes
The main objective of ICI-4,  to be launched from Andøya Space Centre, is to 































explore F-region plasma instability processes in connection with auroral blobs. 































The phenomenon is created when polar cap patches, islands of high electron 































density plasma, exit the polar cap at night, i.e. when they entering the night 































time auroral oval. The ingredients are high density F-region plasma structures, 































imposed by auroral precipitation, field aligned currents and flow shears. This 































appears to be the most violent situation for GPS scintillations. This region is 































a highly complex region of the auroral ionosphere driven by tail reconnection. 































In order to precisely diagnose the launch conditions we will combine 































information from the ACE satellite, radars and all-sky imagers as well as 































ground magnetometers. The campaign period allows 14 effective days from 16-30. 































October. At the day when rocket is launched we will stop the radar operation as 































soon as we have got the large scale context of the detailed in-situ 































measurements. ESR will be operated in an azimuthal scan mode to survey 































transport of polar cap patch material across the rocket trajectory. EISCAT UHF 































will be pointed across the rocket trajectory.
