notes
Heater operations will involve both O- and X-mode, field-aligned with power 
stepping or frequency stepping. The UHF radar will mostly be pointed field-
aligned but with some scanning around the field-aligned direction. Optical 
measurements will also be carried out.

The experiment is overscheduled and part or all of each requested run may be 
cancelled depending on ionospheric conditions and cloud cover. The experiment 
will be co-ordinated with the Russian AARI experiment to avoid clashes and 
maximise scientific outcomes.
