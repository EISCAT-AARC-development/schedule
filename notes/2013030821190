notes
This SP is for ALIS and EISCAT coordinated observations.
Beata pulse code and meridian scanning radar mode will 
be used for the Tromso UHF radar observation. 
We will set the reconstruction region to around the center 
between Tromso and Kiruna. We prefer good weather condition 
for the optical observations.
