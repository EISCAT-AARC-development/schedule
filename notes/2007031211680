notes
The ESR will run the long pulse slopes experiment on the 32m dish.

This experiment is run in conjunction with the OUCH and HEAT experiments at Tromso.

THE RUN IS SUBJECT TO CANCELLATION IF WE DO NOT GET THE REQUIRED TIME ON OUR
HEAT ACCOUNT TO RUN THE TRO UHF WHICH WE BID FOR IN THE LAST ROUND.

The purpose of the experiment is to use both heaters in O mode polarisation to
generate F-region artificial density irregularities which will act as targets
for the CUTLASS radars.  The Heaters will be on continuously and it is hoped we
will observe naturally occurring small scale ULF waves in the backscatter.  The
two heated patches will hopefully be either side of the OCFLB.
The UHF and ESR will provide data as to the plasma environment in the
ionospheric interaction region.
The footprint of the Polar spacecraft will pass through both heater patches
allowing simulatanous measurements of the magnetospheric particle populations
thought to be providing energy to the ULF waves.
