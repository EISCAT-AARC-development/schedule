notes
A network observation using MST/IS radars, complementary observations, and
high-resolution model simulations are conducted during the ICSOM observation
window: 15-31 January, 2016. We will utilize a combined CP-1 and CP-2 scan mode
for the EISCAT observation.
Note that we might shift the EISCAT observational window (18-22 and 25-29
January, 2016) based on predictions of Stratospheric Sudden Warming.
