notes
Experiment objective: Make simultainous radar measurements and
mulitspectral imaging of polar cap patches as they approach the
nightside auroral oval. American colegues are collaborating and will
provide multispectral data from All-sky imagers at KHO and Station
Nord and Qaanaaq in Greenland
Experiment conditions: Clear skies and prolonged IMF Bz < 0 conditions
Both 42 m and 32 m antennas will be used. 42m field aligned and 32 m
antenna will do meridonial half scans from zenith and northward. The
aziumuth scanning direction will be towards station Nord in Greenland
(43.6 degrees west of geographic north).
