notes
Detailed investigation of the angular dependence of the magnetic zenith (MZ) 
effect associated with the heating of electrons. 

The plan is to heat the ionosphere with the heater pump wave directed along the 
local magnetic field in cycles of 1 min on / 1.5 min off. The pump wave 
frequency should be below the local foF2 with O-mode polarization. Use UHF radar 
to obtain electron and ion data at five different angles: MZ, MZ ± 1.5°, MZ ± 3° 
(1 minute at each direction per cycle). This should be synchronized with heater 
cycles. Beata UHF programme should be used.

It is anticipated that the experiment will be run for 2 hours within the time 
intervals in the schedule. Operations will be co-ordinated with those of the 
PMSEOVER experiment.
