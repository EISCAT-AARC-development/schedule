notes
The Tromsø VHF radar should be used in a mode such that density profiles 
covering the full F-region can be obtained.  The elevation should start 
pointing vertically and be altered hourly to decrease to an elevation of 54º to 
the north by the end.  The “beata” mode is probably adequate, but it may be 
that a longer-range low-elevation mode is required for the latter half of the 
observation.  The remote stations should follow the VHF radar beam, scanning 
heights from 200 to 600km in a 30-minute cycle.  Settings will be confirmed 
nearer the time.  Exact VHF antenna zenith angles and times are as follows:
22:00 Vertical
23:00 9 degrees north
00:00 19 degrees north
01:00 29 degrees north
02:00 36 degrees north
