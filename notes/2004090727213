notes
An extra 24 hour  SD-experiment using EISCAT time during the IADC (Inter-
Agency Space Depris Coordination Committee) measurement campaign. The window 
of the campaign will be between September 6th and 20th, 2004.

Special SD-receiver will be used to sample the EISCAT signal on the IF2 level 
(11MHz) at the Tromsö site. Standard EISCAT receivers and DSP will be used at 
the remote sites. Standard EISCAT experiments (with fixed antenna pointing) 
will be used at the Tromsö site and the modified versions of the same 
experiments at the remotes.
