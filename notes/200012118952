LTCS  
     Combined local E and F region measurements, including vector velocities, with 15 minute time resolution. Latitudinal  
     coverage may be sacrificed to meet this goal.

CEDAR-TIMED Joint Observations of the Effects of Storms on the Lower Thermosphere  
     The goal of this project is to gather observations on the temperature and winds in the lower thermosphere during  
     geomagnetic storms. Data from ISRs and supporting instrumentation available at the upper atmosphere facilities are  
     needed in the primary altitude range of 90-150 km with fine altitude and time resolution (similar to LTCS modes).  
     Data at altitudes in the middle and upper atmosphere will also be useful to study coupling with the lower  
     thermosphere. The observations will be made in response to an alert of a major sustained geomagnetic storm (Kp>5 or  
     6), and will be studied in coordination with TIMED satellite observations using general circulation and tidal models. A  
     one-month period will be identified one year in advance, and then narrowed to a 10-day stand-by period 6 weeks  
     before the start of the month. The observations will last 4 full days. We request two such periods in year 2000  
     following the launch of the TIMED satellite (May 2000) and initial validation of its data. The requested periods are for  
     Fall (Sep or Oct) and Winter 2000 (Nov, Dec or Jan 2001).
