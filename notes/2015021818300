notes
Scientific objective of this experiment is to understand the conductance in the
polar cap and auroral region. Conductance and F region line of sight velocity
will also be measured. ESR and VHF will be operated with fixed pointing
directions at 30 degree elevation angle.

The requested experiment windows are:
Feb 16: 1830-2300 (VHF), 1830-2400 (ESR)
Feb 17: 0000-0430 (ESR)
Feb 18: 1830-2300 (VHF), 1830-2400 (ESR)
Feb 19: 0000-0430 (ESR)
