notes
The purpose of this investigation is to use the Heater to stimulate ULF waves,  
which will travel along a flux tube and be detected by instruments on satellites  
such as FAST and Cluster. The intervals booked are therefore dictated by the   
times of satellite overpasses. (This particular interval has been timed to   
co-incide with an overpass of FAST.) The Heater will be operated at full power   
with a dual frequency modulation. The UHF Radar will be employed with the beam aligned to the magnetic field line. The pulse code is expected to be that of   
CP-1L, but tau2 might be used instead. Measurements will also be made using the  
CUTLASS Radar and the Leicester Doppler sounder.
