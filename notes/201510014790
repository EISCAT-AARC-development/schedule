notes
This EISCAT experiment covers Swarm C and A (values for A in brackets) passing 
over the ESR at 12:11:04(13) UT, h=463 km, range=466 km

Az=259.6 (261.2) deg, El=82.8 (78.6) deg

Another pass by Swarm B occurs at 13:56:52 UT, h=519.4 km, range=553.6 km
Az=71.1 deg, El=68.8 deg
==========================================


Three Swarm satellites, A, B, and C, perform high precision magnetic field
measurements using both vector and scalar magnetometers. The
instrumentation includes a thermal ion imager (TII) and Langmuir probe
(LP). Together the LP and TII form the electric field instruments
(EFIs). The PI is David Knudsen <knudsen@ucalgary.ca> from the University of 
Calgary. For LP please contact Stephan Buchert <scb@irfu.se>. Using EFI data 
electron density and temperature, ion drift vector and temperature and the 
perpendicular electric field can be derived. In addition accelerometer 
instruments, onboard GPS receivers and ground-based laser ranging of Swarm 
support a very precise orbit determination.
