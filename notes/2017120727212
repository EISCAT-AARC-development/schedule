This is a collaborative experiment involving radar time from Norway, Sweden 
and UK to cover a number of Cluster conjunctions between December 2017 and 
March 2018.  

During the cusp conjunctions (December 2017 and January 2018) the mainland 
radar provides measurements of features from the open-closed field line 
boundary propagating into the cusp, whilst the ESR monitors the progression 
of features deep within the cusp. However, experience from the 2013/14 
campaign suggests it may be more useful to obtain altitude profiles from the 
mainland for comparison with those under the cusp. Therefore, we propose to 
operate the ESR 32m dish pointing north at low elevation, whilst the 42m 
dish will provide interleaved altitude profiles along the magnetic field. We 
anticipate using the 'taro', 'folke' or ‘steffe’ experiment code on the ESR 
to provide data out to long ranges af a good resolution (~15s). 
Simultaneously, we will operate the mainland VHF at low elevation pointing 
north using the ‘tau8’ code to maximise the range (61-1317km) at 5 second 
cadence, and the UHF radar will be field-aligned to provide altitude 
profile. 

I am booking the time as UK, but we have promises of contributed time from 
Norway and Sweden also.  The contributed hours will need to be confirmed by 
Lisa Baddeley and Stephan Buchert as the responsible scheduling 
representatives.
