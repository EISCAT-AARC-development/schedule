notes
We have been granted 5 hrs of EISCAT time from each of three sources: 
Japan, Norway, and Third-Party, to make a comparison of IPS observations 
at EISCAT and STELAB in June and July of this year. Unfortunately we have 
not been able to make any useful observations as we had overestimated the 
sensitivity of the EISCAT UHF system for IPS. However it would be possible 
to make the comparisons that we need using stronger sources (1008+075, 
1229+020, and 1256-057) in August and September of this year. Unfortunately
neither of us can be at EISCAT during this period, but Richard Fallows of 
the UK, Aberystwyth group intends to come to EISCAT in mid September and has 
volunteered to monitor our observations. There are three opportunities to 
observe in August and early September before Richard will arrive at EISCAT. 
We therefore request that we be allowed to attempt remote observations during 
those periods. We have checked the EISCAT schedules and we see no conflict at 
present.
