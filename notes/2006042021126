notes
Jackie Davies and I have checked the EISCAT/Cluster conjunctions for April 
2006, and we have identified five intervals of potentially high interest.  This 
month continues to be very good for potential cusp conjunctions, since the 
orbit plane of Cluster is still sufficiently close to the Sun-Earth line to 
produce a number of dayside magnetopause crossings.  We have identified three 
potential cusp conjunctions, and two perigee passes which would merit EISCAT 
coverage.  For all these conjunctions, the radar mode should be LowElNorth on 
the ESR 32m dish, with some coarse interleaving of dumps from the 42m.  In the 
past we have suggested 4:1 (32m:42m), which should be acceptable, depending on 
conditions.  VHF should run a single low elevation (30o) beam on boresight, 
using a modulation such as tau1.

The intervals are as follows:

March 4th  06-10  VHF only (ESR in use for CP).  Very good magnetopause 
conjunction over Svalbard.

8th  18-22  ESR, VHF. Perigee pass over the Scandinavian sector.

16th  05-09 ESR, VHF.  Outbound magnetopause crossing, nominally slightly East 
of the ESR.

20th  18-22 ESR only.  Perigee pass over Svalbard.

23rd  06-10 ESR, VHF.  Outbound magnetopause crossing, nominally slightly West 
of the ESR.
