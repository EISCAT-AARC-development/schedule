notes
Ground support of the SERSIO sounding rocket: Svalbard EISCAT-Rocket Study of 
Ion Outflows (PI: Paul Kintner) will investigate ion outflows between 600 and 
800 km altitude in the polar cusp/cleft region. SERSIO will be launched from Ny-
Aalesund to measure ion drifts, electron drifts, electron and ion 
precipitation, convection electric fields and plasma waves. The objectives of 
the experiment are to determine the physical mechanism responsible for the 
ionospheric outflow, the source of free energy for the outflows, and to 
investigate the relationship of the ion outflows to previous satellite 
measurements of vertical ion drifts and sounding rocket measurements of 
transverse ion acceleration at higher altitudes in the polar cusp/cleft. The 
ESR, UHF and VHF radars will be used to monitor ion outflow at the nominal 
rocket apogee to determine the launch conditions and for comparison with the 
rocket data.
