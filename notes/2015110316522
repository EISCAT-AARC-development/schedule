notes
This EISCAT experiment covers Swarm A and C (values for C in brackets) passing 
over ESR at 22:19:08(22:19:25) UT, h=463.9(464.1) km, r=482.2(477.3) km, 
Az=97.7(96.2) deg, El=75.7(71.5) deg.

Passes by A and C at lower elevation are also at 20:54 east Svalbard and at 
23:53 west of Svalbard, by B at 23:15 east.

The ESR 32m should point south so that the ESR data cover a range of latitudes.  

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Three Swarm satellites, A, B, and C, perform high precision magnetic field
measurements using both vector and scalar magnetometers. The
instrumentation includes a thermal ion imager (TII) and Langmuir probe
(LP). Together the LP and TII form the electric field instruments
(EFIs). The PI is David Knudsen <knudsen@ucalgary.ca> from the University of 
Calgary. For LP contact Stephan Buchert <scb@irfu.se>. Using EFI data electron 
density and temperature, ion drift vector and temperature and the perpendicular 
electric field can be derived. In addition accelerometer instruments, onboard 
GPS receivers and ground-based laser ranging of Swarm support a very precise 
orbit determination.
