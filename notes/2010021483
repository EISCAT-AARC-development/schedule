notes
In the over-dense ionosphere: To determine the energy spectrum of HF pump-
induced accelerated electrons resulting from various plasma resonances. In the 
under-dense ionosphere: To determine whether purely collisional heating 
of a plasma can produce artificial optical emissions. For both the above 
cases, we will measure the neutral temperature increase resulting of 
ionospheric modification for the first time, along with the ion and electron 
temperatures. For an overdense ionosphere, the Heater will operate in a 
standard cycle of 2-min on, 2-min off in O-mode. The beam pointing will 
alternate between field-aligned and vertical. For an underdense ionosphere, 
the Heater will operate in a standard cycle of 2-min on, 2-min off with beam 
pointing field-aligned. The polarisation will alternate between O-mode and X-
mode. The UHF monostatic radar will track the Heater beam using a standard 
radar code, e.g. beata. Moon-free, cloud-free sky and geomagnetically quiet 
conditions are required. Cancellations are anticipated.
