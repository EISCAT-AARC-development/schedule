notes
The purpose of this experiment is to investigate the height profile of the 
557.7nm emission line, by making EISCAT measurements simultaneously with FPI 
observations. To do this, the EISCAT UHF Radar will be employed to make 
magnetic field-aligned measurements of the ion temperature. These will then be 
compared with FPI observations aligned with the EISCAT beam to establish the 
height of the emission line. The use of the FPIs means that these operations 
must be carried out during the hours of darkness, and therefore outside EISCAT 
working hours. They will also require clear skies.
