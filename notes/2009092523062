September 2009 corresponds to the 2009 tail campaign of Cluster, with the orbit
close to the Sun-Earth line and apogee on the nightside.  We have selected four
tail conjunction intervals where Cluster is close to the EISCAT-ESR meridian
around magnetic midnight as follows:

September 13 21-01 (14)
September 18 20-24
September 20 21-01 (21)
September 25 20-24

Preferred mode is tau0 boresight mode at 30 degrees elevation on the VHF, with
LowElSouth on the ESR, interleaving (4:1) between 32m and 42m dishes.
