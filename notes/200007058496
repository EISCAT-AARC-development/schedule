notes
Mid-July Baseline   
     The purpose of this experiment is to help improve our statistics of all the parameters measured by the ISRs. These are   
     deficient in summer. In particular seasonal effects on magnetospheric convection are not well established for the   
     differing levels of geomagnetic activity. Another 2-day experiment at any time during July, 2000 would satisfy this   
     objective. The widest latitude coverage possible should be obtained, as good time-resolution is not required for   
     building up our statistics.
