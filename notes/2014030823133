notes
PI: Akimasa Ieda
Scientific objective of this experiment is to understand the conductance
in the polar cap and auroral region. Conductance and F region line of
sight velocity will also be measured. ESR, VHF, and UHF will be operated
with fixed pointing directions including zenith or 30 degree elevation
angle. In case the UHF is NOT available on March 7, instead we will run
the VHF towards north. (El=30)

The requested experiment windows are:
March 7: 03-07 UT (UHF, otherwise VHF), 01-07 UT (ESR)
March 8: 13-17UT (VHF, UHF, ESR)
