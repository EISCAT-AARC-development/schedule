notes
Measurements around a predicted overpass by Swarm satellites. UHF field-aligned,
VHF vertical with remote stations. 42m field-aligned, 32m either low elevation
southward or along Swarm orbit northward. 1 hour overlap in VHF with Esa
Turunen's pulsating aurora experiment will be resolved during the campaign.
