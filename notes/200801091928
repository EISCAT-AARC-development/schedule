notes
The SCIFER-2 launch vehicle will be a Black Brant XII rocket, capable of 
achieving an apogee of 1400 km.  The mission payload consists of a 5.5m boom 
to 
measure electric fields, ELF and VLF emissions and plasma waves; four “top 
hat” 
particle detectors (two sets of two, on short booms) to measure the field-
parallel and field-perpendicular phase space distributions of electrons and 
ions, a retarding potential analyser with upward and downward-looking heads to 
measure electron energy and temperature and a boom-mounted magnetometer from 
whose data field-aligned currents can be calculated. An extensive description 
of the SCIFER-2 rocket, together with details of the payload, the science 
goals 
and the ethos of the launch campaign can be found at 
http://www.dartmouth.edu/~aurora/scifer2.html.

We propose to use all three of EISCAT’s radar systems in support of the SCIFER-
2 campaign.  The most important measurements will come from the EISCAT 
Svalbard 
Radar, with the 32m steerable dish being pointed to the nominal apogee of the 
rocket flight while the field-aligned dish provides contextual information 
along the local field line.  The mainland VHF radar will be used in low-
elevation boresight mode, looking essentially geographic north at an elevation 
of 30o.  The UHF radar will also be used in a low elevation northward pointing 
mode, but offset in azimuth from the VHF so that electric fields can be 
inferred using the “beamswinging” technique.  The aim of both mainland radars 
is to characterise the latitudinal variation of the ionosphere up to and 
beyond 
Svalbard, while the ESR provides a direct measurement of conditions below and 
up to the rocket volume.
