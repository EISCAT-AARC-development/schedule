notes
The purpose of this investigation is to use the Heater to stimulate ULF waves,   
which will travel along a flux tube and be detected by instruments on satellites 
such as FAST and Cluster. The intervals booked are therefore dictated by the     
times of satellite overpasses. (This particular interval has been timed to      
co-incide with an overpass of Cluster.) The Heater will be operated at full power with a dual frequency modulation. Neither radar will be employed specifically for this experiment on this occasion, although it is expected that simulteous VHF Radar measurements will be made for another experiment. There may also be CUTLASS Radar and the Leicester Doppler sounder measurements.
