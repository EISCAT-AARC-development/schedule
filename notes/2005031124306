notes
The goal of the campaign is investigation of the fine temporal and spatial 
structures of the optical emissions stimulated by the HF ionospheric heating, in
particular the pump-power dependence of the emissions will be studied. 
Multipoint, multiemission optical observations by ALIS will be conducted 
simultaneously with running the high-resolution arc1 program by UHF EISCAT 
radar. If ionospheric conditions will be insufficient ( critical frequency 
less than 4 MHz) we will run same observations to study the influence of the 
HF heating on natural aurora.
