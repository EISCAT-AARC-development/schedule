notes
I am submitting three Cluster requests for May 2003, as follows:

May 1st  16-20 UT (ESR, UHF, VHF)
May 4th  05-09 UT (ESR only)
May 16th 04-10 UT (ESR, VHF)

In addition, the interval

May 28th 04-08 UT (ESR, VHF)

would have been added, but is already covered by a World Day Common Programme (CP4+CP4L) which uses basically the required modes.

Comments on each of these intervals:

May 1st 16-20 UT.  I know that this is a holiday and so may not be possible.  If it is, I would request LowElNorth + field-aligned (1:1 interleaving) on the ESR, together with single-beam low elevation tau1 on the VHF and field-aligned tau2 on the UHF.  If only one mainland system is available (e.g. due to work on the VHF klystrons) the low elevation northward-looking observations could be done on the UHF, using tau3.

May 4th 05-09 UT. ESR only using LowElNorth + field-aligned on the two ESR dishes (1:1 interleaving).

May 16th 04-10 UT. ESR as for May 1st and 4th.  VHF as for May 1st.  If VHF unavailable, use UHF with tau3 at low elevation.

May 28th 04-08 UT.  Already covered by CP.  If CP does not run for any reason, then use geometry as for the 16th.

Priority Order:

May 16th
May 28th
May 1st (but I'm aware this probably won't run because of the holiday)
May 4th
