notes
The purpose of this experiment is to verify that SPEAR O-Mode HF-pumping will 
produce an observable artificial optical emission. (This is in preparation for 
the CASSIOPE satellite due for launch in 2007.) A standard program will be run 
on the ESR simultaneously on both the 32m an 42m antennas, with the 32m antenna 
being pointed vertically. SPEAR will transmit O-mode below foF2 on a 2 min. 
on / 2 min. off cycle - or possibly CW. Artificial optical emissions will be 
observed using the AFRL imager located at Ny Alesund.
