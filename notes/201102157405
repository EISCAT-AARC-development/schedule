notes
SPEAR will be used to transmit HF waves at a range of frequencies to produce 
enhanced ion lines which will be detected using the ESR radar.
ESR 32m dish will be pointed in a fixed direction along the magnetic field
CUTLASS radars will also be used to detect small-scale irregularities generated 
by SPEAR
