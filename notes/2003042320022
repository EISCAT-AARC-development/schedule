notes
Modification of CP-3, with antenna to "track" selected GPS satellites. Will
analyze data for TEC and Ne-gradients and compare with TEC and scintillations
observed by GPS receivers. We apply for 30 Norwegian and 30 Swedish SP-hours.
We plan eight more runs of six hours each in the time period May-June. 
We ask for assistance to programme antenna movements. Similar application from Norway.
