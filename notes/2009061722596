notes
The experiment will run the UHF tri-static in combination with the VHF.  The
experiment will observe small scale plasma density irregularities in the
ionoshere which cause transionospheric radio waves to experience random
fluctuations in amplitude and phase.
The experiment will combine data from EISCAT with VHF/UHF beacon signals from
polar orbiting satellites, L band signals from GPS satellites, and the SuperDARN
radars.
