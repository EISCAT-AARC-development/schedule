notes
The aims of the experiment using the EISCAT Svalbard Radar together with EISCAT
Aperture Synthesis Imaging (EASI) and the Auroral Structures and Kinetics (ASK)
instrument are:
   - to study the occurrence and spatial distribution of NEIALs using radar
interferometry techniques and optics with high spatial and temporal resolution,
   - to study the energy distribution within and surrounding narrow auroral 
forms (especially when associated with NEIALs),
   - and apply the results to theories of NEIAL occurrence and production, and 
in general to theories of auroral acceleration processes.
  The experiment is a collaboration between Sweden (14), Norway (14), and Sweden
(12). Pulse code
LT4FL will be run on the Radar.
