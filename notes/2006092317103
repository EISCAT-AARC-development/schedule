HF-SEE
A campaign to investigate mainly HF-pumped but also natural (auroral) Langmuir
and upper-hybrid turbulence, by using HF interferometry of Stimulated
Electromagnetic Emissions (SEE) by the PGI (Russian) group, HF Doppler
measurements (AARI, Russia, CUTLASS), ASK optical measurements, ALIS, and
probably other diagnostics.
Investigators include PGI group (Tereshchenko, Khudukon, Yurik et al.)
B. Isham, V. Belyey, C. La Hoz, A. Brekke, T. Hagfors, B. Gustavsson, 
N. Balgoveshchenskaya, M. Rietveld. 
Suggested hours are from: GE(90), NO(??), FR(??), EI(20?) others ?

This request is preliminary, and subject to confirmation from collaborators,
agreement on national time allocations, changes/negotiations
in case of conflicts. It is also overbooked so that cancellations are
inevitable. All three systems are booked but may not run simultaneously 
all the time. The times are chosen to have a stable quiet daytime
ionosphere, but also some dark nightime ionosphere.
