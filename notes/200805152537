3rd Party Experiment 
This experiment will compare SuperDARN data of the ExB flow across the polar cap
with line of sight velocity observations made by the ESR.  The measurements will
be centred around noon and midnight MLT so as best to observe the anti-sunward
flow across the polar cap.  
The 32m dish will be doing a 48 degree wide azimuthal scan, centred on the
magnetic pole direction, at a 30 degree elevation.  The scan will feature a
number of specified positions (nominally 8) with a dwell time of approx 54
seconds in each position.  Taking into account the time needed to move the dish
this would work out at approx 8 mins for a complete scan.
