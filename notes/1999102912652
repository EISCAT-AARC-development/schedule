notes
The Heater will be employed to excite F-Region irregularities, whose spectral characteristics will be measured by the CUTLASS Radar. Background parameters will be monitored by the EISCAT UHF Radar.                  
                  
Please note that this time interval may be used by experiment SP-UK-OUCH instead.
