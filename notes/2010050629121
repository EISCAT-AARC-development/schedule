notes
The principal purpose of this experiment is to use radar interferometry to 
obtain the highest spatial and temporal resolution possible from ESR 
measurements. A complimentary objective is the study of naturally enhanced ion 
acoustic lines (NEIALS).
The experiment will employ both of the Svalbard antennas, together with 
three recently installed panel arrays. It is the intention to use the LT4 
pulse code.
  This investigation is a collaboration with UK and with Norway, who will be 
contributing 12 hours to the campaign.
