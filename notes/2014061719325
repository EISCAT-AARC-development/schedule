notes
Three Swarm satellites were launched on November 22, 2013, into polar
orbits. They perform high precision magnetic field measurements and carry 
Langmuir probes designed and built by IRF Uppsala and thermal ion imagers (TII) 
by the University of Calgary, PI David Knudsen. Together the LPs and TIIs form 
the electric field instruments (EFIs). From the EFI data electron density and 
temperature, ion drift vector and temperature and the electric field are 
derived,
essentially the same parameters as EISCAT measures, but with very
different spatial coverage and temporal resolutions.

This one is for Swarm B passing over ESR at 7:05:00 at 524 km,
Az=-86.233 deg, El=80.410 deg
