notes
The aims of the experiment using the EISCAT Svalbard Radar together with 
EISCAT Aperture Synthesis Imaging (EASI) and the Auroral Structures and 
Kinetics (ASK) instrument are:
    - to study the occurrence and spatial distribution of NEIALs using radar 
interferometry techniques and optics with high spatial and temporal resolution,
    - to study the energy distribution within and surrounding narrow auroral 
forms (especially when associated with NEIALs),
    - and apply the results to theories of NEIAL occurrence and production, 
and in general to theories of auroral acceleration processes.
   The experiment is a collaboration between Sweden, Norway, and UK. Pulse 
codes LT4FL and Beata will be run on the Radar.
   Please note that this booking is part of a continuation of the sequence of 
bookings made earlier by Nicola Schalatter. The time resources quoted for this 
booking, namely Sweden (14 hours), Norway (23), and UK (23 hours), should 
cover also the earlier set of bookings.
