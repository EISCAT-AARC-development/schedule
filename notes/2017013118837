notes
We wil run the EISCAT UHF radar and tristatic VHF radar with the sodium LIDAR and a new 5-wavelength 
photometer. Clear sky is desired. Based on the simultaneous data, evaluation of Joule heating and derivation 
of ion-neutral collision frequency are targets. We book three nights, but if it would goes very well for the first 
two nights,  we will cancel the last night.
