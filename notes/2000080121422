notes
Application is for time to supplement the GE application (same Expt. name). PI is Jurgen.  
We plan to operate jurg1 around noon time for about 4-6 hours to use up all the 
allocated time within the first half of August 2000. Time and data should be pooled and Jurgen is authorised to distribute the Norwegian allocation at his discretion. 
 
The full campaign name is PMSE-2000/ESR, (same for GE), (the "/ESR" distinguishes it from other radars also observing PMSE)
