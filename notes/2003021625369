notes
The purpose of this investigation is to use the Heater to stimulate ULF waves,  
which will travel along a flux tube and be detected by instruments on satellites
such as FAST and Cluster. The intervals booked are therefore dictated by the    
times of satellite overpasses. (This particular interval has been timed to     
co-incide with an overpass of Cluster.) The Heater will be operated with frequency modulation. The mode of operation of the UHF Radar has yet to be decided, but here CP-1L has been given as the experiment was operated in this mode when it was last run. Please note that the times booked are provisional, and may be revised.
