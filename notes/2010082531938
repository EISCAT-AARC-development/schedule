notes
This request is for ground-based radar support of the THEMIS/ARTEMIS mission.  
THEMIS is NASA's multi-spacecraft magnetospheric exploration mission, of which 
one spacecraft is being put into lunar orbit to explore lunar/solar 
interactions.  This spacecraft becomes the ARTEMIS mission.

At the end of August, the ARTEMIS spacecraft makes a pass through the magnetic 
tail at a distance of about 75 RE, and this offers a potentially interesting 
chance to study tail dynamics processes in conjunction with ground-based radars.

We are requesting three experiments during this interval, of which two are 
directed at combined EISCAT/ARTEMIS observations, and one is directed at 
supporting a passage of THEMIS through the cusp.

For all experiments, a low-elevation mode on boresight should be used on the 
VHF, and a low-elevation northward looking mode should be used on the ESR with a 
modulation scheme such as steffe or tau0 which is optimised for good range 
coverage.  ESR data can be interleaved between the 32m and 42m dishes in a 
suggested ratio of 4:1.
