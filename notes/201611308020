(To have up and going at 22:00)

We will perform a collaborative study of dual-frequency meteor head echoes 
using UHF, the MAARSY radar, and a set of optical systems temporarily 
installed at ALOMAR. We prefer good weather conditions at ALOMAR for the 
simultaneous optical observations and cancellation may occur. UHF will point 
at elevation 37 and azimuth 257 to a measurement volume 100 km above MAARSY.
