notes
From Mar.1 to 20, we plan to carry out long detection of VLF(6kHz-10kHz) 
radiation produced by ionospheric heating using EISCAT VHF radar and heater.
The receivers will be installed at Kannuslehto near Sodankyla Geophysical 
Observatory and XinJiang in China respectively.
In fact, the success in this experimnet will greatly depends on the ionospheric 
background conditions, so during the period of order as above, we will find a 
chance with the good background to perform the experiment.
Also, considing the logistics for the receiving staff in China, it will be 
better to perform the experiment in daytime.
