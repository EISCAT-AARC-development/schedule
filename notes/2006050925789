notes
With the Cluster orbit moving away from the Sun-Earth line, May is no longer 
such a good month for Cluster conjunctions.  However, we have identified three 
conjunctions which would be well worthwhile to cover with EISCAT observations, 
namely

May 5 06-10 UT (magnetopause crossing)
May 9 16-20 UT (perigee pass) and
May 21 16-20 UT (perigee pass)

the May 5th interval has the highest priority of these.  Observing modes should 
be as for April (see the April notes), steffe low_el_north on the ESR, 
interleaving obsevrations from the 32m and 42m dishes at something like 4:1, 
and low-elevation boresight tau1 on the vhf.
