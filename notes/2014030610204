notes
We plan to observe the scintillation effect for the radiation from discrete 
cosmic source (DCS) Cassiopeia A in the polar ionosphere modified by powerful 
EISCAT heater. As a recording system we are going to use KAIRA facility. For 
monitoring the ionospheric conditions we will use EISCAT UHF radar.
