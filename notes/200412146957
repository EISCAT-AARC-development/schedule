notes
The CUTLASS Hankasalmi radar will be used in a frequency-sweeping mode to measure the  
elongation of F-region striations generated using the Heater. The UHF radar will perform a scan  
along the Hankasalmi-Tromso path to measure the electron density to enable raytracing  
analysis of the HF radar propagation path. The requested time is over-scheduled and  
cancellation will occur depending on geophysical conditions and resources consumed. Quiet  
conditions are preferred. Typically only 4 hours out of each 6 hour block will be run, probably  
either 10-14 UT or 12-16 UT. The AAEV experiment could be run if CRASE is cancelled, or  
vice-versa.
