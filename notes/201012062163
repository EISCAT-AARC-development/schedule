notes
In this experiment we will use the combined resolving power of EASI and ASK to
determine the horizontal structures of the Naturally Enhanced Ion Acoustic
Echoes (NEIALs). Previous studies have revealed that the backscattering
structures are less than 300 m perpendicular to B over several 100 km along. The
combined radar+optical observations will clarify the relation between NEIALs and
flaming auroral rays. EITHER LT4 or iSlopes will be run.
