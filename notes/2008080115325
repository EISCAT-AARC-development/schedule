runexp /kst/exp/ei/folke/folke 8 eclipse FR

The use of both antenna is requested to observe and help model the response of
the dayside polar ionosphere to the passage of the total eclipse.
The 32m will be pointed towards the north at low elevation to study the
propagation and evolution of a breifly non-sunlit ionospheric region.
