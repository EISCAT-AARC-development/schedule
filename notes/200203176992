notes
This experiment is an investigation into the role of Alfven waves in the                    
coupling between the auroral zone and the magnetotail. EISCAT observations will                 
be made in conjunction with optical and satellite measurements. It will employ                
the UHF and VHF Radars on the Mainland and both Svalbard antennas. The VHF                
Radar may be operated in single beam mode on 08/09 March, but for the remaining intervals (15/16, 17/18, and 27/28 March) operation in dual beam mode is                 
considered essential. The pulse codes are tau0 on the ESR, tau1 on the VHF                 
Radar and tau2 on the UHF Radar.
