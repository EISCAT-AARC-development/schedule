notes
The experiment is aimed at investigating the scattering of signals from the 
EISCAT heater at ionospheric irregularities produced by the heater radiation 
itself. To that end we plan to monitor Doppler spectra of the heater signals at 
several greatly dispesed receiving sites in Europe and the USA.
Another isssue is investigating field-aligned ionospheric irregularities though 
observations of discrete cosmic source scintillations using imaging riometers.
