notes
We have discovered two different flow channels events by EISCAT Svalbard
Radar in the fast azimuth scam mode (SP-NO-FASM) . i) The Reversed Flow
Channels connected to discrete daytime auroral forms of which direction
opposing the background flow; ii) Flow channels events in the cusp inflow
region consistent with the magnetic tension pull of newly reconnected flux.
The observation material is still sparse and we need more observational
material to advance our studies. After having developed real-time plotting
for the SP-NO-FASM, we are now able to see data with only 1-2 minutes delay
and can very effectively search for FCE's.
Together with the ESR scanning the dayside cusp, parts of the campaign are
planned to be run with Sondrestrømfjord, Poker Flat and Resolute Bay in
addition to ESR in order to cover a largest possible area of the polar cap
in order to look how FCE's move (if they do) and be able to monitor cross
polar cap transport in great detail. SuperDARN radars will be asked to join
for HF large scale.
