notes
The Special Norwegian Fast Azimuth Scan Mode (SP-NO-FASM) on the EISCAT 
Svalbard Radar (ESR), originally designed by Carlson et al. [GRL,2002], is a 
powerful tool to map mesoscale flow structures in the cusp ionosphere. The 
emphasis on this winter campaign is to further study the Reversed Flow Events 
(RFEs) first discovered by Oksavik et al. [GRL 2004] and Rinne et al. [JGR 
2007]. Reversed Flow Events (RFEs), are ~100-200 km wide east-west elongated 
channels, in which ion flow opposes the background convection. The RFE 
phenomenon appears to be connected to Birkeland current arcs, and is likely a 
magnetosphere-ionosphere coupling phenomenon [Moen et al. JGR 2008]. This 
winter we have the ICI-3 sounding rocket of which aim is to intersect an RFE 
flow channel. RFEs that have an average life time of ~18 minutes, i.e. quasi-
static flow structures. The ICI-3 payload is instrumented with E-field, B-
field and electron spectrometer to test the hypothesis whether the RFE 
phenomenon is as a possible inverted V footprint in a low conductance 
ionosphere [Moen et al. JGR 2008]. 
The RFE phenomenon may be a very important facilitator of HF backscatter 
irregularities in the cusp ionosphere. Carlson et al. [JGR 2007] documented a 
rapid development of plasma irregularities observed by scintillation (~10s km 
to 100s m) in connection with patch formation above Svalbard. These 
irregularities had too rapid onset to be explained by any mechanism other than 
the Kelvin Helmholtz instability (KHI). They suggested that once the KHI 
builds up large amplitude irregularities, these large seed irregularities 
allow other instabilities such as the GDI to feed off them. I.e. a two step 
process. The complementary information by the rocket, will enable us to obtain 
a physical description of instabilities and wave phenomena driven by the RFEs 
in the winter cusp ionosphere; of particular relevance to satellite 
communication and navigation systems and space weather models.  In-situ 
measurements by sounding rockets will be needed to parameterize the boundary 
conditions for realistic modelling of the different modes. 
We emphasize that we really need to improve our data base of concurrent ESR 
and auroral observations of the RFE phenomenon; as we currently have only 2 
days of this unique combination! The ESR observations will be critical to 
diagnose that launch criterions are met for ICI-3, as well as giving the 
geophysical context of the detailed rocket data.  Reversed Flow Events (RFEs), 
reversed by means of flow opposing the background convection. RFEs are ~100-
200 km wide east-west elongated channels that have an average life time of ~18 
minutes, i.e. quasi-static flow structures (statistics based on 10 days of ESR 
data from 2001 and 2002).
