notes
Scientific objectives are to investigate the response of neutral temperature in
the thermosphere and mesopause to different auroral energy inputs and processes
and to validate a new technique for inferring F-region neutral temperature from
spectrographic measurements of O+ aurora. Field-aligned only â€“ no scanning.
Arc-slice is the preferred experiment to use. This a collaboration between
Sweden and the UK with the latter contributing 14 hours and former 6:
UK(14) SW(6)
