notes
The primary aim of the project is to acquire complementary data from bottom
ionosphere upward by coordinating STEIN and EISCAT measurements, as well as
comparing high-latitude phenomena vs. ring-current development.
We would like to book radar hours for our CINEMA project in 17-19 December. For
all the days we would like to use both ESR radars (42m field aligned and 32m low
elev. along the north-south meridian; BEATA) in 20.30 - 00.30 Local Time.
