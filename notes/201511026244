notes
Russian EISCAT/heating campaign (AARI_HFXP) is planned from 28 October to 7 
November 2015. Experiments will be carried out from 13 to 17 UT under quiet 
magnetic conditions. The experiments to be cancelled due to unsuitable 
ionospheric conditions. We will continue to carry out experiments related to 
the studies of phenomena in the F-region of the ionosphere (plasma parameters, 
turbulence, artificial field-aligned irregularities, narrowband SEE spectral 
components) induced by powerful X-polarized HF radio waves. Phased array 1 will 
be used in the course of the experiments. The main attention will be paid to 
the determination of the threshold values of effective radiated power (ERP) 
needed to generate various X-mode HF-induced phenomena at heater frequencies fH 
lying above and below the critical frequency foF2 as well as to the comparison 
of the ERP thresholds of alternating O/X-mode effects at heater frequencies fH 
â‰¤ foF2.
