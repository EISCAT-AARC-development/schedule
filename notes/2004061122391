notes
The primary aim of this experiment is to repeat the observations made in March 2003 of 
echoes at ranges between ~6000 and 16000 km in order to determine their cause. The period 
of greatest interest will initially be 19-22 UT as this corresponds to the times when the echoes 
were received in the previous experiment.
