notes
Meridian scanning experiment going from 74.8 down to 66.6 degrees north, as used in January 2002.  The elan file is on puny, and can be found in
/opt/kst/exp/uk/tau3t_limb_UK.

Three four-hour slots are requested for Setpember 2002 in support of CHAMP
overpasses.  One of these will be cancelled nearer the time.  Some tweaking
of the run times may be necessary, because CHAMP is currently in low orbit which makes accurate prediction of overpasses two months in advance very difficult.
