notes
Space debris observations in standard EISCAT space debris mode. Raw voltage 
requested. We would like to use the standard EISCAT space debris experiment in 
standard Eastward pointing direction. We request space debris processing with 
Jussi's software. The goal is to get an up-to-date statistical estimate of the 
space debris environment.
