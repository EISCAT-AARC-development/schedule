notes
This experiment is an investigation into the role of particle precipitation and the auroral emissions produced, a particular goal being the identification of the role of proton precipitation. The proposed experimental mode is tau0 modulation on (probably) the Svalbard Fixed Antenna. Observations are to be made in conjunction with the UK spectrometer located in Adventdalen.
