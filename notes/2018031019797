notes
We require active aurora in the region of the tracer releases. We also require
clear skies for ground-based camera observations at two of four sites for
observation of the releases at the time of the launch.
We request the use of EISCAT Tromsø UHF and VHF radar facilities to detect
ionization and plasma drifts in the ionosphere for a period of three hours
centered around the time of the launch.
We require the electron density, ion/electron temperature and line-of-sight ion
velocity at altitudes between 80 and 300 km.
