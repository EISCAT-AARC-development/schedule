notes
Pi: Satonor Nozawa 

This experiment aims at examining variations of the temperature between 80 and 110 km due to aurora 
effect (from above) and atmospheric wave effect (from below). Clear sky and aurora activity are desired. 
UHF mode will be  CP-2 mode-like (beata), but its scan pattern will be different from standard ones. 
Collaborations of Japan and Norway.

Since CP is run, we would like to cancel SPs during bad weather.
