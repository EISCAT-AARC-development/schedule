notes
This is a single entry for the UK HAIL and POND experiments by Lancaster 
University, which both require similar conditions and heater/radar operations.

The Heater will operate field-aligned, O-mode. For the HAIL experiment, 
frequency stepping will be applied to keep the frequency above the local 
gyroharmonic frequency as the interaction height descends.
