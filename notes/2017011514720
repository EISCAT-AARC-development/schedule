notes
This EISCAT experiment covers first Swarm A+C and then DMSP F17 passing over
Tromssa on January 15. According to the latest orbit predictions, the closest
approach of Swarm A+C takes place at 06:43 UT, with maximum elevation of 89
degrees. DMPS F-17 passes about 7 minutes later, with maximum elevation of 88
degrees.

We request simultaneous measurements by UHF (field-aligned) and VHF (vertical,
tri-static).
