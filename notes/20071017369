notes
Some of these runs might/will be cancelled. Within the Finnish campaign, first priority is for support of the 
Finnish/Swedish NEMI instrument aboard Hotpay 2, second priority is for heating experiments ANTII. The 
setup is the same for both targets: we need the VHF pointing vertical and will run arc-dlayer. If running for 
ANTII, we might also run Markku Lehtinen's special experiments. PI: Esa Turunen, Antti Kero.
