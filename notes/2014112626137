notes
Reverse-flow events (RFEs) were first observed in incoherent scatter
data and have since been studied in detail. They are fast flows (~1
km/s) in the opposite direction of the background convection flow,
typically extending several 1000 km in longitude but only about 100 km
in latitude. Whereas their connection to dayside reconnection is quite
well studied, their connection to polar cap patch formation and the
location of the return flow of this feature is unknown. We plan to
study RFEs and their return flow by using two SuperDARN radars in a
specifically designed mode in conjuction with the ESR in
windscreen-wiper mode and auroral imager observations from Svalbard.
