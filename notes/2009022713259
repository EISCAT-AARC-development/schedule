notes
During February 2009, THEMIS is in its optimal alignment in the magnetotail. I 
am requesting two experiments in satellite pool time to provide EISCAT 
observations during the interval of best alignment between the THEMIS 
spacecraft.  The US radars will also be running during this interval. These 
intervals follow on directly from the SUBTLE experiment, requested by Jim Wild, 
which will look for substorm signatures in the longitude sector of EISCAT.  
Depending on conditions, the radars can either continue with the configuration 
used for SUBTLE (i.e. ESR pointing south and VHF pointing north) or, if SNR is 
good enough, but radars can be pointed magnetic north to give the maximum 
latiude coverage.
