notes
ESR and ground-based optical campaign with purpose to study ionospheric plasma  
dynamics in relation to cusp auroral activity.  Three experiment modes are  
proposed: 
1. Fixed beam pointing towards the magnetic North pole at low elevation 
2. Scanning along the magnetic meridian 
3. Azimuth sweeps at low elevation 
Which mode to be run will be decided according to geomagnetic and auroral  
conditions.
