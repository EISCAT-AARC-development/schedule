notes
The "LANCS" schedule entry covers three separate experiments from Lancaster 
University, UK 
which require similar conditions:

MZE UK(17) Investigation of the magnetic-zenith effect
PLEE UK(12) Effect of heater-accelerated electrons on the plasma line
PRAISE UK(17) Artificial aurora

PRAISE will only be carried out from 14-16 UT and requires clear skies for 
optical support. 
MZE and PLEE will be carried out between 10 and 14 UT. If PRAISE is to be run 
then either MZE 
or PLEE will be run from 12-14 UT in order to satisfy the minimum 4-hour run for 
the 
experiment which ends outside normal site working hours. If PRAISE is not run, 
MZE and/or 
PLEE will be run sometime during the 10-14 UT interval, i.e. inside normal 
working hours.

All three experiments require quiet geomagnetic conditions. Cancellation is 
likely, 
especially for PRAISE (14-16 UT) due to the need for clear skies.
