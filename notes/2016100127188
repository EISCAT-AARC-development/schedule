notes
We will perform a collaborative study of dual-frequency meteor head echoes 
using UHF, the MAARSY radar, and a set of optical systems temporarily 
installed at ALOMAR. We prefer good weather conditions at ALOMAR for the 
simultaneous optical observations. UHF will point at elevation 37 and azimuth 
257 to a measurement volume 100 km above MAARSY.
