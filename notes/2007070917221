notes
We plan to make PMSE observations with the ESR at 500 MHz using a new radar 
program at an unprecedented altitude resolution of 150 m. This will yield new 
insight into the real vertical extent of PMSE at such high frequencies. In 
addition, simultaneous measurements with the SOUSY radar at 53 MHz will be used 
to study the frequency dependence of PMSE.
