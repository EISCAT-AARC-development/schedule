notes
In June, the ESR is scheduled to run a long Common Programme, continuously 
until June 25th.  There are a large number of ESR/Cluster conjunctions in 
this interval, but given that none of them is perhaps particularly 
scientifically exciting, and that all of them will be covered by some 
sort of ESR observation, I suggest that no specific ESR/Cluster 
experiments are scheduled for this interval.

The only interval that I suggest adding as a specific request for 
EISCAT/Cluster operations in June is 28/06/2004 01-07 UT, which might 
(depending on solar wind) be the one of the first flank-skimming orbits of the 
year, close to conjugacy with EISCAT.  No radar experiments have yet been 
requested for this interval, and since the overpass is fairly close to ESR it 
would be worth requesting CP1 at ESR and (1-beam) CP4 on the 
mainland.
