notes
A heating experiment is designed to detect the temporal and spatial variation 
of pump-induced electron temperature, electron density and ion line. The UHF 
radar will work in the scan mode to get the time constant in different 
directions. VHF radar will be used to measure the outflow at topside of F 
region and modulation in D region. The UHF and VHF will run a standard code 
manda.
