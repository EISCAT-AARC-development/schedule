notes
The purpose of this experiment is to investigate the height profile of the 
630nm emission line, by making EISCAT measurements simultaneously with FPI 
observations. (It is a fundamental concern of instruments such as the FPI to 
know the height at which these emissions occur.) To do this, the EISCAT UHF 
Radar will be employed tristatically in a CP1-like mode, with an intersection 
height of 240km. FPIs at Kiruna and Sodankyla will then be used to observe this 
common volume, while a third FPI at Skibotn will scan along the line of sight 
of the Kiruna FPI. The use of the FPIs means that these operations must be 
carried out during the hours of darkness, and therefore outside EISCAT working 
hours. They will also require clear skies.
