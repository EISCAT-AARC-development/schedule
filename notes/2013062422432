notes
Using the 224MHz receiver (with us) to observe the front scattering of VHF radar
(Fresnel scattering) by PMSE and study the aspect sensitivity of PMSE.
The beam of VHF radar should be tilted to 7.5 degree south(dependency of
altitude of PMSE), and the 224MHz receiver be installed near Svartnes ( 69¡ã22¡¯N
,19¡ã15¡¯E, 23km south of EISCAT ). Meanwhile, the beam of Heater will be same
direction as that of VHF radar and disturb PMSE to confirm that the 224MHz
receiver does receive the front scattering by PMSE, rather than the diffraction
or others.
