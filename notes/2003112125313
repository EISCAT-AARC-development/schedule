notes
Heating for Langmuir turbulence effects, i.e. plasma and ion-line measurements,
together with Swedish/Japanese HF-optical emission campaign.
The actual program is not yet decided (lt or tau2_pl) so whether
remote sites are used is uncertain.

These experiments should be joint GE:EI with the following hours: 30:30
The EISCAT special time (30 hours total) is from B. Isham.
