notes
This EISCAT experiment covers Swarm A and C (values in brackets) passing over 
TRO at 12:20:18 UT, h=462 km, r=463(470) km, 

Az=95.7 (94.4) deg, El=86.2 (78.9) deg
==========================================


Three Swarm satellites, A, B, and C, perform high precision magnetic field
measurements using both vector and scalar magnetometers. The
instrumentation includes a thermal ion imager (TII) and Langmuir probe
(LP). Together the LP and TII form the electric field instruments
(EFIs). The PI is David Knudsen <knudsen@ucalgary.ca> from the University of 
Calgary. For LP contact Stephan Buchert <scb@irfu.se>. Using EFI data electron 
density and temperature, ion drift vector and temperature and the perpendicular 
electric field can be derived. In addition accelerometer instruments, onboard 
GPS receivers and ground-based laser ranging of Swarm support a very precise 
orbit determination.
