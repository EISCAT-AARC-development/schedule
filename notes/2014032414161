notes
There are two windows for this one alert run. The decision to start will be based on predictions of magnetic disturbances. If there is no run in the March-April window, the next possibility is during the period from 14 September to 01 October. In the case of no magnetic storm, the run will fulfill the alternating-year quiet time measurements and will start on 27 September. The alert should be announced 5 days before the start of the run.
