notes
Alignments of the THEMIS spacecraft along the magnetotail continue during March
2009. I am requesting two experiments in satellite pool time to provide EISCAT 
observations during the interval of best alignment between the THEMIS 
spacecraft.  The US radars will also be running during this interval. As in
February, these intervals follow on directly from the SUBTLE experiment,
requested by Jim Wild,which will look for substorm signatures in the longitude
sector of EISCAT.  Depending on conditions, the radars can either continue with
the configuration used for SUBTLE (i.e. ESR pointing south and VHF pointing
north) or, if SNR is good enough, but radars can be pointed magnetic north to
give the maximum latiude coverage.
