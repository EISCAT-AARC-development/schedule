notes
This experiment addresses the lower ionospheric/thermospheric vertical motion, which is one of the 
critical aspects of Mesosphere-Thermosphere-Ionosphere coupling at high latitudes. The vertical wind 
structure is not fully understood, although it is quite significant because one consequence of vertical 
mixing associated with vertical motions is to modify the thermospheric and ionospheric compositional 
structure. The goal of this project is to estimate vertical neutral winds using ionospheric parameters 
observed with the EISCAT UHF radar, and to determine vertical neutral and plasma motions 
accompanying geomagnetic and climatological activities. 

This experiment will be done under collaborations of 3 countries such as Japan, Norway, and France.
At now, Nozawa could not confirm the French SP time, but we think they will  contribute 9 hrs.
