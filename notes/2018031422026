notes
This is the latest in a series of schedule requests to cover a series of 
EISCAT/Cluster conjunctions between December 2017 and March 2018.  

Unlike the conjunctions of December 2017 and January 2018, the February and 
March 2018 conjunctions occur in the auroral zone. Hence the ESR32m dish 
should now be pointed SOUTH at low elevation, whilst the 42m dish will 
provide interleaved altitude profiles along the magnetic field.  As in 
December and January, we propose to use the ‘folke’ code on the ESR.  
Simultaneously, we will operate the mainland VHF at low elevation pointing 
north using the ‘bella’ code to maximise the range coverage, and the UHF 
radar will be run field-aligned using the ‘beata’ modulation, to provide 
altitude profiles.   In summary:

- Modulation scheme “bella” with pointing file “lowel1” on the VHF
- Modulation scheme “beata” with pointing file “cp1” on the UHF
- Modulation scheme “folke” with pointing file “lowelsouth” on the ESR 
- Interleaved data from the ESR 32m dish

I am booking the time as UK, but it is possible that other countries may 
also chose to contribute.
