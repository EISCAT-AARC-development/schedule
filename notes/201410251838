notes
The main attention will be paid to the comparison between threshold effective 
radiated powers to produce HF-induced phenomena under O- and X-mode heating. 
Experiments will be carried out between 14 and 26 October 2014 from 14 to 18 UT 
under quite magnetic conditions by using the HF heating facility (HEA) and 
Tromso UHF radar (TRO). It is expected that the observations at Tromso will be 
supported by the CUTLASS (Leicester University, UK) and by the ALIS optical 
observations (IRF, Kiruna). Some X-mode experiments are planned for the SWARM 
passes above Tromso. Experiments for ELF/VLF emissions can be carried out 
during disturbed magnetic conditions. The experiments to be cancelled due to 
unsuitable ionospheric conditions.
