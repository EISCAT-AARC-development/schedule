notes
The HF facility will operate field-aligned, X-mode, 4 minutes on, 2 minutes off 
with brief low power O-mode interruptions to the X-mode pulses.

These schedule entries are made on the basis that the runs will only be charged 
for two hours of operation, not four hours and that there will be flexibility 
regarding cancellation. If this will not be the case, the request may need to 
be revised!

The experiment requires low geomagnetic activity and clear skies for optical 
observations, so cancellation is expected.
