notes
Aims:

1) Measure vertical winds and decay times from API. For this a 24hr run
is important to remove wind bias from tides. Follow up earlier work
started by Vierinen et al., 2013.

2) Try a magnetospheric radar mode if conditions are not suitable for API
(e.g. no E or F region reflection between 5.4 and 8 MHz)

3) Search for HF stratospheric echoes below 20-30 km as suggested by
Reid, 2015, based on early observations at 2.75 MHz by Czechowsky et al.,1983
