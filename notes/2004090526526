Cluster sees often  O+ in the tail and the lobes, and it is interesting to find 
out from where the O+ comes, where and how it is energized etc (auroral outflow 
vs dayside outflow). I presented some data about the subject at the workshop in 
April. For this we need also events when ESR (or Sondrestromfjord) is on the 
dayside for proving that upflow occurs while Cluster is in the tail or northern 
lobe. In these configurations there is no conjunction between Cluster and the 
groundbased radar.

Suitable periods are

05/09/04 0700-1100 ESR
12/09/04 0700-1100 ESR

(TC1 is also at suitable positions in the tail for 05/09 and 12/09, however it 
cannot distinguish ions.)

I suggest to add these periods, if possible.
