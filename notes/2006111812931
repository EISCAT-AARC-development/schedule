notes
This is a combination of three UK experiments:

FACE: field-aligned currents and mapping the energy of precipitating particles
BATTY: tomography of "black aurora"
MISS: substorm studies

All three experiments require the UHF system during the same time interval,
hence the combined booking. The UHF will operate either field-aligned only or a
small-scale scan close to field-aligned. The decision on scan pattern and
modulation will be made at the time of the run. The experiments depend to a
large degree on clear skies for optical support and are slightly over-booked.
Therefore, some cancellation can be expected.
