notes
###  Note: We are requesting time from Sat 3 Jan due to predictions of good
activity on 3 and 4 Jan.  We expect to run 4 nights, but we are requesting 6 in
order to allow flexibility in scheduling at the Tromso site.  ###  Radar, radio,
and optical observations of naturally-enhanced emissions (ion-acoustic,
Langmuir, radio, and optical waves) conducted near local midnight and/or during
satellite passes.  ISR data will be recorded using VHF vertical and UHF vertical
or field-aligned simultaneously, or at low elevations, using both IL and PL
channels on both antennas.  Radio emission data will be recorded using a
wide-band (0-10 MHz) receiver provided by Interamerican University and Dartmouth
College operating at the Auroral Observatory.  Optical data will be recorded by
collaborating instruments.  HF radar data will be provided by SuperDARN.  The
Swarm A and C satellites will pass in close proximity at and near field-aligned
overhead the Tromso site at about 0110 UT on some of the requested nights.
