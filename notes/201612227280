notes
The aim of observation is to study the ionospheric plasma structures in the 
dayside polar cap/cusp region using simultaneous observations by ESR, DMSP 
satellite, and FPI near Svalbard. The ESR will point at the field-aligned 
direction. We prefer good weather condition for optical FPI observation.
