Placeholder request for observations during the total solar eclipse of August 1 
2008.  I assume this will be replaced by a request for an agreed Common 
Programme.  Details can be decided nearer the time, but one idea is to combine 
field-aligned (42m) observations with off-axis (32m) measurements of the E-
region within the path of totality.  Such a mode has been requested by Chris 
Davis (UK).
