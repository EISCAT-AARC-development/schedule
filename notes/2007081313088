notes
During the period 1-15 Agust 2007 there will be an international sounding 
rocket campaign at the Andoya Rocket Range, i.e., the ECOMA-summer campaign 
(ECOMA=Existence and charge state of meteor smoke particles in the middle 
atmosphere). Within this campaign we will launch three payloads with 
instrumentation to measure charged aerosol particles, plasma constituents, 
neutral aerosol particles (photometry and sampling experiments), and 
turbulence parameters. Local measurements of PMSE with an MST radar and 
measurements with the EISCAT VHF and UHF radars will be used for defining the 
launch criteria. Besides their role in the rocket campaign, we intend to study 
the frequency dependence of PMSE. This is particularly interesting since only 
very few examples of PMSE observations in the UHF are available so far.
