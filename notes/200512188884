notes
In December 2005, the Cluster orbit is almost orthogonal to the Sun-Earth line, 
and the main interest is therefore in the flank-crossing orbits where Cluster 
emerges from the magnetosphere into the solar wind.  We have selected two such 
intervals where the egress is close to magnetic conjugacy with EISCAT on 
December 11th (09-13 UT) and December 18th (10-14 UT).  For both of these, we 
are requesting coverage by VHF and ESR in the standard modes used for Cluster.  
On the ESR this means LowElNorth on the 32m dish interleaved with observations 
on the 42m.  A relatively coarse interleaving (say 4:1 32m:42m) would be 
acceptable if SNR was poor on the 32m.  On the VHF, a low elevation mode along 
boresight should be used.

We are also requesting coverage (ESR only) for the perigee pass on December 6th 
(02-06 UT) when the ESR mode should be as above, since the magentic footprint 
of the conjunctions is somewhat north of Svalbard.
