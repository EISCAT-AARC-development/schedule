notes
The students of AGF-304 (radar diagnostics of space plasmas) will require some
data to analyse and interpret as part of the course.  Several of these students
are also going to take the course AGF-301 (physics of the upper polar
atmosphere) which has field work at the auroral station this week.  Having radar
data from a period where the students already know the geophysical background
would be great advantage, pedagogically.  I am quite willing to collaborate with
others who are interested in the same hours, but I would prefer to run
relatively simple experiments, so that the students can understand the
modulations and the analysis.
