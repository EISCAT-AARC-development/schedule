notes
Main goal is to identify HF heating effect signatures on the meteor observations when the meteor 
environment is artificially modified by means of HF heating.

Main instrumentation is HF Heating, EISCAT VHF and TGO meteor radars.

There have been some apparent instrumental issues on the meteor radar measurements during first 
campaign that are under evaluation, present campaign is subject to the outcomes of such evaluation and 
may be cancelled and postponed.
