notes
This experiment supports development of new SuperDARN radar techniques aimed at 
measuring plasma and neutral density. EISCAT will provide pump-induced 
irregularities as a backscatter target for SuperDARN as well as radar 
verification of the measurements. The UHF radar and Heater will operate field-
aligned. The heater will pump CW at very low power on a non-gyroharmonic 
frequency.
