notes
Multiple heating modulation schemes are to be used to study different processes in the ionosphere, 
including electron acceleration, artificial aurora, SEE, ELF (Schumann and Alfven band) wave excitation.
ESR observations will be complemented by other instruments such as optical instruments, ePOP satellite, a 
network of HF receivers, and ELF band magnetometer.
