notes
Joint campaign by UiT, University of Southampton, and KTH,
Stockholm, using coordinated optical and radar observations
of structured auroral precipitation. Long pulse and/or AC
experiment will be run in the interferometric mode (receiving
on 3 antennae). Supporting optical observations include the
Spectrographic Imaging Facility at the auroral station in
Adventdalen, and the Odin UiT narrow field camera at the ESR.

(it is preferred to have continuous run for a few complete
mornings rather than loose hours before and after cusp - hence
the overbooking).
