notes
IN CASE CP3 is run, we use the tri-static VHF radar, instead, to observe the E-fields.

We aim at investigating variations of ion temperature and electric field in
the F-region (Thermosphere) in order to understand more deeply the basic
state of the polar Thermosphere as well as the coupling between
Magnetosphere-Ionosphere-Thermosphere in the polar region. We run the Tromso UHF radar and ESR.
PI is Prof Fujiwara.   We have requested 3 days, but we will only two days out of the 3 days.
In case CP3 is run, we like to make tristatic VHF radar observations instead.
