notes
The purpose is to make preliminary tests on EISCAT Heater impact on GPS-signal. Especially, the 
occurrence of scintillation will be investigated. The experiment will use EISCAT Heater (antenna field 2) 
and UHF. Data from GPS receiver(s) located in Sodankylä and potentially also in some other Lapland 
stations will be used in the analysis.
