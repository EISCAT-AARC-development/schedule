notes
In January 2008, Cluster is still on the magnetospheric flank, with apogee 
approaching the dayside as the month continues.  This month also sees the 
beginning of the THEMIS science phase with alignments of the spacecraft along 
the magnetotail steadily improving as the month progresses.  Because of this, 
we are requesting four midnight sector intervals at the end of the month where 
two or more THEMIS spacecraft are aligned along the tail.  At least one of 
these intervals will also have good complementary observations from a Cluster 
perigee pass.  

Given the low densities currently being experienced, the best mode for the ESR 
would probably be to run LowElSouth and tau0 i.e. looking southward, with 
something like 3:1 interleaving (32:42).  The VHF would point northwards at 30 
degrees elevation along boresight, running tau1.
