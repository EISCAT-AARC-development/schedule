notes
Simultaneous scintillation observations at EISCAT and STELAB will be conducted
between 26 June and 24 July. We need 30 hrs of actual time. This translates to
15 hrs of EISCAT time if we use the 1400 MHz receivers at S and K, and 7.5 hrs
if we use only the 933MHz receivers. Since we want to try both, we need 15 hrs
of EISCAT time. We request 5 hrs each from Japan (through PI Kojima,
kojima@stelab.nagoya-u.ac.jp) and from Norway (through PI Esser,
ruth.esser@phys.uit.no), and are requesting 5 hrs of "Third-Party" time from USA
because PI Coles is not associated with an EISCAT member country.
