notes
This experiment will employ the Heater only. The times have been revised to     
avoid conflict with a Swedish experiment, and, as a result, supersede an earlier booking. It is anticipated that only three of the four intervals booked will be used. Please note that the time quoted under "Resources" is that of a pool with other UK experiments. There are plans for these to run in April/May of this year.
