notes
This request is part of the international support for two NASA sounding 
rockets: CAPER and RENU2. Both rockets will be launched from Andoya and over 
the ESR, most likely on different days. Decisions about observation modes will 
be made on the day of launch, according to weather conditions, launch 
priorities at Andoya, etc. However, we expect to use 42m data in combination 
with 32m data along the rocket track. 

Observation time for this campaign is provided as follows:
- Jim LaBelle’s third party allocation for CAPER
- Marc Lessard’s third party allocation for RENU2
- Tim Yeoman UK allocation
- Kjellmar Oksavik/Lasse Clausen NO allocation
