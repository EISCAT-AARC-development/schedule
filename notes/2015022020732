notes
The purpose of this experiment is to provide training to students taking the
AGF-304 radar course at UNIS.
We plan to use both antennas, and depending on the geophysical conditions at the
time, we will use different pulse codes (e.g.beata, ipy, tau0 and taro) and a
combination of fixed positions, azimuth and elevation scans. 
The students will decide on the operating mode and pulse code used based on a
proposal they have submitted as part of their course. The data will be used for
their project work.
We will have optical support from KHO and will cancel one of the runs if
conditions are not suitable for optics.
