notes
This experiment is a joint effort of Lisa Baddeley and Kjellmar Oksavik to 
utilize SPEAR and ESR in conjunction. The time is slightly overbooked, but we 
plan to cancel if conditions are not suitable. For some runs around 06 - 11 UT 
we may also decide to switch to different experiment modes, all depending on 
ionospheric conditions. Primary target of this time interval will switch 
between these two options:

1) Observations of large and small scale ULF waves in artificial backscatter 
in the CUTLASS radars induced using O mode heating combined with heating 
effects observed in the F-region ionosphere.
Ionosphere requirements:  stable F region with FoF2 peak at SPEAR heater 
frequency
Experiment Code: SLOPES / STEFFE
Radar pointing direction: TBD but most probably F.A.

2) Observations of artificially generated ULF waves induced using X mode 
modulation of SPEAR beam at Hz or mHz frequencies.
Ionosphere requirements: stable E region
Experiment Code: SLOPES / STEFFE
Radar pointing direction: TBD but most probably F.A.
