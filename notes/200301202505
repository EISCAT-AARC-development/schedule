notes
 There will be 2 rocket sequences (2 days), each of 12 hourly rockets. Americans got a launch window from January 20th for 2-3 weeks. 
They will launch rockets at midday when it will be good weather conditions for 
lidar observations. Thus, I can't plan in advance at what day and time the EISCAT experiment will start. Therefore I ask to give this experiment a first priority and reserve for it 8 hours (09-17) every day for interval Jan.20-Feb.9.
In fact it will be 2 days for 8-14 hours = 16-28 hours.
