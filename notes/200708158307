notes
We ask 3 times 8 hours starting time at 0000UT and finishing at 0800UT. 
Preferentially on 14/08, 16 and 17. The idea is to rur our observation when 
common program runs in ESR.

Eiscat will have to send invoice. It will be good to have this invoice before 
the end of this year.Wlodek Kofman will be alone and will need some help.
