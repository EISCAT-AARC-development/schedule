notes
Although the best THEMIS tail alignments are now past, good Cluster cusp 
conjunctions continue throughout April.  We have selected three events which 
are suitable for coverage by EISCAT, in the usual cusp configuration.  This 
means steffe LowElNorth on the ESR 32m dish, with field-aligned observations 
from the 42m being interleaved at 4:1 (32m:42m).  On the VHF, the system should 
be run in tau1 mode with the beam fixed on boresight at 30 degrees elevation.

The conjunctions are:

April 7th (06-12 UT)
April 19th (05-11 UT)
April 26th (06-12 UT)

The 7th and 26th are outbound cusp passes, the 19th is an inbound pass.
