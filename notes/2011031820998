notes
The purpose of this experiment is to study the dayside ionosphere. Particular 
areas of interest are signatures of poleward moving forms, polar cap patches, 
and flow channels that enter the dayside polar cap. This experiment also 
provides training to students taking the AGF-304 radar course at UNIS. We plan 
to use both antennas, and depending on the geophysical conditions at the time, 
we will use different pulse codes (e.g. tau0 and taro) and a combination of 
fixed positions one day, and azimuth and elevation scans the next day. We may 
also use the SPEAR heating facility for part of the run. The purpose is to 
show the students different ways of operating the radar, and collect data that 
they can use for GUISDAP analysis, project work and thesis work.
