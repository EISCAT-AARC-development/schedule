notes
The UHF will operate field-aligned, most probably running tau2pl.
The Heater will operate 4 min on, 4 min off, 8 min on, 8 min off, 16 min on, 20
min off (60 min cycle), O-mode, field-aligned.

This experiment is heavily overscheduled, but takes place entirely within normal
working hours. The experiment requires a stable ionosphere with foF2 > 4.04 MHz
for heating.
