notes
We need to measure the electron temperature, electron density, ion temperature,
ion drift velocity as well as the time history of these variables. We also need
to measure the ion- line and plasma-line profiles. We also need to run high
resolution dynasonde data when the heater is off.  We need to measure various
irregularities to figure out the absorption so we also need VHF radar running. 
High resolution of the Field Aligned irregularities will be also measured by the
CUTLASS radar (SuperDARN) as well as the time histories of FIAs.
