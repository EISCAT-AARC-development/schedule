notes
This experiment aims at study of tidal and planetary waves in the lower themosphere.
We like to extend CP-2 run to 8-days window, with which  we can work on
tidal variability as well as Q2DW.
So far, scientis from 4 countries are involved.  
In case some ploblems happen in the beggning of the CP-2 run on November 11, we like 
to extend our run so that 8 days of data window can be achieved.
