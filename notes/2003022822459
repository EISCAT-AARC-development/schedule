notes
We will make an optical campaign using high resolution aurora cameras
and 4-wavelength photometer with EISCAT UHF radar.
We strongly hope to use the ARC mode (at field-aligned position) with the UHF radar.
Sweden will contribute 8hrs to this campaign. Also Norway will contribute
10hrs or more (under negotiations).
