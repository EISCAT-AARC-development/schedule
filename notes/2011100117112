notes
Interplanetary scintillation test observations in conjunction with LOFAR and 
KAIRA if available, plus other worldwide sites on a few days (TBD).

Do not panic over the block booking; this is only to indicate days on which we 
may wish to observe.  Exact schedule of observations to be determined.
