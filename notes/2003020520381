notes
For February 2003, I am requesting three Cluster intervals, all of which are possible cusp conjunctions with simultaneous SUPERDARN coverage.  The Cluster apogee is moving from the post-noon sector towards the pre-noon sector at a rate of about two hours MLT per month.  The best cusp encounters for EISCAT/ESR will be mid-March, but February conjunctions are already potentially useful.

The three intervals are:    February  5th 6-12 UT
                            February 12th 7-13 UT
                            February 24th 6-12 UT

For the 5th and 12th, the experiment should be the "classic" Cluster orientation, namely fixed Low Elevation North on the ESR, interleaved (1:1) with field-aligned observations and tau1avsingle on the mainland VHF.
On the 24th only the VHF is available, the ESR having been requested for a tomography experiment, so I am only requesting tau1avsingle on that day.
Comments and queries welcome !
