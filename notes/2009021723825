notes
We (Jussi Markkanen, Markku Lehtinen and Juha Vierinen) want to run a 25 h space debris
measurement for the upcoming ESA space debris conference. There has
recently been renewed interest towards this from ESA, so it would be
nice to show some new results. We need 24 h to
cover all directions, and one hour extra for possible experiment
start-up problems. In addition, we would like to measure orbital
elements of the debris cloud caused by the Chinese space defence
experiment.
