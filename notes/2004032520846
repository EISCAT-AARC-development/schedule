notes
March 2004 contains the best of the dayside passes for this year.  I am 
requesting five intervals of EISCAT operation as follows:

March 01   07-13 UT
March 06   05-11 UT
March 13   07-13 UT
March 25   05-11 UT
March 29   17-23 UT

The first four of which are outbound magnetopause crossings in the vicinity of 
EISCAT/ESR, with possible cusp crossings and the fifth is an auroral perigee 
pass.  The runs on the 1st and 25th will be combined operations with 
Sondrestrom, which will be running from 12-16UT on the 1st, and from 00-05 UT 
on the 25th.

The optimum mode on all days would be LowElNorth on the ESR 32m dish, 
interleaved (1:1)with field-aligned observations on the 42m dish.  The mainland 
should use the VHF in low-elevation northward looking mode (tau8) or the UHF in 
tau1u dual-klystron mode if the VHF is not available.
