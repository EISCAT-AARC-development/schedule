notes
The aim is to study dynamical ionospheric features related to bursty bulk flows. The experiment utilizes 
both the VHF (tau8) and UHF (tau1) radars, which are pointed at 30 deg elevation north (VHF and UHF to 
geographic and geomagnetic north, respectively). In addition, simultaneous ESR 32m (30 deg elevation to 
geomagnetic south) and 42m antenna measurements (taro) are used.
