notes
This is a collaborative study with the Finland group to study the dissipation of
the electromagnetic energy input from the magnetosphere and the effect on the
thermospheric dynamics. The two experiments (code name: EMEnergy and EMEnergyJ)
are conducted continuously with the same observation mode.
