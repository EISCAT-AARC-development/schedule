notes
We will study the HF-induced phenomena in the F-region of the ionosphere under 
contrasting O/X mode heating near the critical frequency or under X-mode 
heating when the heater frequency is above the critical frequency of the F2 
layer. Experiments will be conducted with power, angle and frequency stepping 
the HF pump wave. The UHF radar will be pointed in the magnetic field-aligned 
direction or will be scanned between 74 and 92 degrees. We also would like to 
repeat our October 2012 experiment when for the first time the X-mode 
artificial aurora was seen by ALIS. These observations again will be carried 
out in collaboration with IRF (Urban Brandstrom and others) with the use of 
ALIS. The phased array 1 resulting in ERP = 600 - 1200 MW will be mostly used 
in the course of experiments. Experiments will be carried out from 17 to 22 
February from 12 to 18 UT and from 23 to 26 February from 7 to 15 UT with the 
use of  HF heating facility (HEA) and Tromso UHF radar (TRO). The experiments 
to be cancelled due to unsuitable ionospheric conditions.
