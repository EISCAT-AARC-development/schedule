The scientific objective of this experiment is an improvement 
in our understanding regarding the thermospheric response during 
periods of geomagnetic disturbance. A Fabry-Perot interferometer 
(FPI) placed at the Tromsoe EISCAT radar site by STEL, Nagoya 
University, and the EISCAT UHF radar will join the experiment to 
measure both the thermospheric and ionospheric parameters, 
respectively. The FPI will be operated at two wavelengths, 557.7 nm 
and 630.0 nm. The UHF radar will be run with the CP-2 mode of the 
beata pulse code. We hope good weather condition with some 
activities of aurora.

The experiment periods requested are:
2010-Nov-04 (Thu) 1800UT - 2010-Nov-04 (Thu) 2400UT (6hours)
2010-Nov-05 (Fri) 1800UT - 2010-Nov-05 (Fri) 2400UT (6hours)
