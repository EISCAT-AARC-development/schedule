notes
Preparation and trial runs for a larger campaign in January -   
Interferometry and/or plasma line observations co-ordinated with   
high resolution tv recorder.   
We will use the long pulse experiment slp0 for the interferometer   
(both antennas) and the plasm0 alt. code (42m ant) for the plasma lines.
