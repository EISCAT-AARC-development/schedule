notes
We want to investigate the angular distribution (with respect to B) of Naturally  
Enhanced Ion Lines (NEIL) by use of the 42m up B, and the 32m in fixed positions  
(on the order of the beam width) south. By using the ESR and Sondy simultaneous   
we can investigate k-vector differences on the occurrence and the angular   
distributions of the NEIL
