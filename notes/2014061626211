notes
This is a five hour observation of the natural radio source CTA21 at a time 
when 
it passes very close to Venus. VLBI telescopes will observe phase scintillation 
from the Venus Express spacecraft. Intensity scintillation will be observed 
with 
EISCAT, LOFAR and other worldwide systems.  Please note that Richard Fallows 
will not be at EISCAT at this time, but will need to operate the system 
remotely.
