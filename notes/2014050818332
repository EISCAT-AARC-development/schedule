notes
N.B. This is a joint Finnish-Norwegian (UO-UiT) experiment. This time slot submitted by Lassi on behalf of 
Björn.

We request a test setup for the first quadriphase-coded incoherent scatter experiment with EISCAT UHF. A 
new experiment with quadriphase coding and EISCAT raw data sampling will be designed in co-operation 
with J. Markkanen. Voltage level USRP sampling will be used in parallel with the EISCAT recording.
