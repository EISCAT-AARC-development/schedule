We are very happy for the two suggested Cluster conjnctions to be scheduled as
second priority behind the Coronal Holes experiment
The preferred mode is the standard one for EISCAT/Cluster operations, namely 
northward-looking VHF, accompanied by dual radar ESR operations, with the 32m 
dish in LowElNorth mode and the 42m dish field-aligned, with data dumps being 
alternated (1:1) between the two dishes.
