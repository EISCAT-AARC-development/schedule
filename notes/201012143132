notes
The idea is to look for meteoric dust particles at the polar wintertime mesophere through the transient 
caused by (scattered) sunrise 07-09 UT. Interestingly, the project period covers the meteor shower 
(Geminids) and the time of day (07-09 UT) the maximum occurence of the Polar Mesosphere Winter 
Echoes (PMWE). Heating will be used for modifying the PMWE and dust properties. The TEQUILAsunrise is 
designed to be a complementary to the ECOMA project.
