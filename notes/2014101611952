notes
Using EISCAT UHF radar and heating facility, the further campaign of the
apparent large electron density enhancements with wide altitude extents deduced
by ionospheric heating, will be carried out. The heater will be operated at
frequency sweeping near 3, 4, 5 and 6 times gyro with O mode, and pointed at
field-aligned and spitze angle respectively. UHF radar should operate at Beata
mode and point as heating beam.
