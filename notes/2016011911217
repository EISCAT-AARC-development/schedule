notes
The first goal of the present project is to identify any HF heating effect signatures on the meteor 
observations when the meteor environment is artificially modified by means of HF heating.

Main instrumentation is VHF radar (MANDA), HF Heating, and TGO meteor radar.

Expected support measurements by TGO MF wind velocities and And√∏ya meteor radar.

Two HF heating modes, one hour duration each one.
