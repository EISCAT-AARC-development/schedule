notes
A scan pattern will be specified later, with several look directions cutting at
a slant angle across the E region in a potential sounding rocket measurement
volume over Esrange. ALIS will have common volume configured in the same locus
to monitor the aurora. Special programme operation on SuperDARN Finland radar is
reqested with higher range and time resolution the common volume.
