notes
We plan to continue studies contrasting O/X-mode heating effects in the over- 
and underdense ionosphere F region. Phenomena near electron gyro harmonics will 
be also studied. Behavior of artificial  small-scale field-aligned 
irregularities, electron density and  temperature and ion velocities in the 
over- and underdense ionospheric plasma due to HF pumping with O/ X-
polarisation will be studied. Experiments will be carried out from 1 March to 8 
March every day from 12 to 18 UT by using the HF heating facility (HEA) and 
Tromso UHF radar (TRO). The experiments to be cancelled due to unsuitable 
ionospheric conditions or can be moved on earlier or later hours from 12 and 18 
UT.
