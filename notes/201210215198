notes
The aims of the experiment using the EISCAT Svalbard Radar together with EISCAT
Aperture Synthesis Imaging (EASI) and the Auroral Structures and Kinetics (ASK)
instrument are:
   - to study the occurrence and spatial distribution of NEIALs using radar
interferometry techniques and optics with high spatial and temporal resolution,
   - to study the energy distribution within and surrounding narrow auroral 
forms (especially when associated with NEIALs),
   - and apply the results to theories of NEIAL occurrence and production, and 
in general to theories of auroral acceleration processes.
For the observations clear skies are needed and depending on weather forecast
radar hours will be cancelled. We overbook by a factor of 2.
  Pulse code LT4FL, beata or arc_iASK will be run on the Radar.
