notes
The purpose of this experiment is to study particle precipitation and auroral 
structures by means of radar measurements made in collaboration with various 
optical observations. It is envisaged that the experiment will employ the 42m 
antenna using the "arc" pulse code. The experiment will require clear skies and 
disturbed conditions.
