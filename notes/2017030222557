notes
The main purpose is to study the magnetic zenith effect during ordinary mode HF
pumping of the quiet ionospheric plasma, especially variation of electron
heating at different angles to the magnetic field. Experiments to determine the
fraction of Ohmic heating and heating due to other effects will be attempted.
The pump frequency needs to be below the ionospheric critical frequency.
