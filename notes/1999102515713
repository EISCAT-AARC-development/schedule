notes
The Heater will be operated in a continuous mode at low power. Any ULF waves generated will be measured by the CUTLASS Radar and the Leicester HF Doppler sounder (DOPE), with the EISCAT UHF Radar being employed to monitor background parameters.                             
                             
Please note that this time interval may be used by experiment SP-UK-HEAT instead.
