notes
The aims of this experiment which require the use of the EISCAT Svalbard Radar 
are:-
   - to study the occurrence and spatial distribution of NEIALs using 
interferometry techniques
   - to study the energy distribution within and surrounding narrow auroral 
forms (especially when associated with NEIALs),
   - and apply the results to theories of NEIAL occurrence and production, and 
in general to theories of auroral acceleration processes.
  The experiment is a collaboration between UK, Norway, and Sweden, each of 
whom will contribute 14 hours to give a total of 42 hours.
