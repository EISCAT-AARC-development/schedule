notes
We request radar time to support the work of the ISSI team "Multi-Scale
Variations in Auroral Electron Precipitation"
(http://www.issibern.ch/teams/auroralelectron/). The requested time coincides
with SWARM conjunctions over northern Fenno-Scandia, and forms part of a
campaign which also includes MIRACLE, ALIS, KAIRA, and satellite beacon receivers.

We prefer clear skies with aurora over Kilpisjarvi. Clear skies over Tromso are
not vital.

We plan to scan the UHF radar either to the north or south while running the
Beata experiment. The VHF radar will be used to measure D-region parameters.
