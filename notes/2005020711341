notes
Recent years of observations of naturally enhanced ion-acoustic lines at ESR have
shown a clear relationship between these and dynamic rayed aurora. 
As both the source mechanism behind these enhanced spectra and rayed aurora
to a large extent remains unknown, we are eager to look for the same phenomena 
on the mainland.
By combining the tau2pl experiment with the University of Tromsø  
high-resolution auroral imager at times when the probability of observing
both enhanced echoes and small scale dynamic aurora is at its maximum, we 
hope for success.
