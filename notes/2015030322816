notes
Radar, radio, and optical observations of natural and HF enhancements (ion-acoustic, Langmuir, 
gyro line, radio, and optical) preferably conducted during satellite passes. ISR data will be 
recorded using VHF vertical and UHF vertical or field-aligned mostly simultaneously, using both IL 
and PL channels on both antennas.  Radio emission data will be recorded using a wide-band (0-10 
MHz) receiver provided by Interamerican University and Dartmouth College operating at the 
Auroral Observatory.  Optical data will be recorded by collaborating instruments.  HF radar data 
will be provided by SuperDARN. 

During 2000-2300 UT on 1, 3, and 5 March we will dovetail with KAIRA_UK observations looking 
specifically for gyro line enhancements at low elevation on VHF and UHF.  KAIRA_UK and RONE 
require identical conditions.  If KAIRA_UK cancels, so will RONE.
