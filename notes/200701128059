In January 2007 the orbit plane of Cluster is at roughly 45 degrees to the Sun-
Earth line, and conjunctions with EISCAT typically occur in the time sector 11-
13 UT (post-noon sector).  The three requested periods correspond to times of 
possible magnetopause crossings with magnetic conjugacy close to EISCAT.
They are January 5th 09-13 UT, January 12th 10-14 UT and January 31st 10-14 UT.
On the 12th, the ESR is already requested for an auroral/optical expriment, so 
we are just requesting VHF coverage to supplement the ESR data from the SP 
which will use (at least) the field-aligned beam from the 42m dish.

It should be noted that Cluster is undergoing a succession of orbit manoeuvres 
at the beginning of 2007 and so some checking will need to be done once the 
planning of these manoeuvres is clear, to make sure that there are no conflicts 
between these selected intervals and possible interruptions to Cluster data-
taking associated with the manoeuvres.
