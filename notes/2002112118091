notes
The experiment target is the observation of Jupiter's synchrotron radiation
(JSR) at 930 MHz. We plan to make the JSR monitoring quasi periodically; i.e.,
30 min observations will be held approximately every 1hr in 5 to 6hr a day.
In each observation unit, both Jupiter and some flux calibration stars will be
observed with elevational sweeping of the antenna for monitoring atmospheric
temperature.
