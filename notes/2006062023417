notes
We intend to perform simultaneous and common volume measurements with the EISCAT 
Svalbard Radar (ESR) and the SOUSY Svalbard Radar (SSR) in order to study the 
frequency (length scale) dependence of PMSE, and the dependence of PMSE on the 
background ionization.

For doing that with ESR, we want to use a code developed earlier by Jürgen Röttger. The first two days of this campaign will be dedicated to testing this radar code (two hours each days). Afterwards, we want to measure four hours each day around midday for a total number of twenty days (80 hours). In the not too probable case of a solar flare, we would like to adjust our schedule and measure during such disturbed conditions for as long a period as possible.
