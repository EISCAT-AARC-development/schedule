notes
This is the heater part of the artificial Langmuir turbulence and aurora experiment, see the notes for the UHF part.

This booking supersedes the Swedish "HFoptical" booking, which should be deleted.
Note that the Swedish "arcHeating" booking still stands, as this is part of the alternative experiment on natural auroras, which requires more active conditions.
