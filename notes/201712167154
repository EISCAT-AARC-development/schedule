Tracking of Polar Cap patches (PCPs) across the entire polar cap from their
formation in the cusp region to their disappearance into the night time auroral
oval.
Science Aims:
 Direct measurements of the ionospheric convection velocity through multi-radar
tracking of PCPs augmented with optical data where possible
 Comparison with co-located SuperDARN ionospheric velocities (both fitted and
direct line of sight)
 Temporal variation of PCP velocities
 Spatial variation of the PCP
