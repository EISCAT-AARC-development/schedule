notes
The purpose of the experiments is to train Ukranian scientists in as many aspects of the EISCAT radar as 
possible at the Ramfjord site - understanding the radar experiments and data acquisition, running 
experiments and analysing the recorded data. This experiment will also include coordinated heater 
experiments to study artificial ionospheric modification effects.
