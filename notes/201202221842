notes
This a joint entry for several UK heating experiments which require similar 
operating times and conditions:

Lancaster University

HAIL UK(45): heater-induced ionisation layers with optical diagnostics
PLEE UK(8): plasma line diagnostics of heater-accelerated electrons

Rutherford Appleton Lab

RAMAN UK(24): Raman amplification of radio waves in the ionosphere

Cancellation is likely due to unsuitable weather conditions for optical 
observations 
or due to elevated geomagnetic activity and also because of limitations on the 
UK 
mainland budget. The experiments will be co-ordinated with the Russian team 
during 
the overlap with the HOX_RU campaign.
