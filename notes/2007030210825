notes
The Heater will run O mode field aligned with an initial on / off period
followed by on continuously to generate F- region artificial irregularities for
the CUTLASS radars.
This experiment is run in conjunction with the POUCH experiment at the ESR.

The purpose of the experiment is to use both heaters in O mode polarisation to
generate F-region artificial density irregularities which will act as targets
for the CUTLASS radars.  The Heaters will be on continuously and it is hoped we
will observe naturally occurring small scale ULF waves in the backscatter.  The
two heated patches will hopefully be either side of the OCFLB.
The UHF and ESR will provide data as to the plasma environment in the
ionospheric interaction region.
