notes
SPEAR will be running in O mode at a frequency close to the foF2 peak as part of
a joint UNIS and NWRA heating campaign.

The experiment is timed to co-incide with a DMSP satellite conjunction and
special time has been requested on the CUTLASS SuperDARN radars

The experiment requires geomagnetically quiet conditions both during and before
the experiments.
