notes
The VHF radar will run the standard "manda" program for different pointing
positions such as 90°, 80°, 70°. 

If echo is strong it is desirable to use remote Rx. 
The experiment WILL BE ONLY RUN if conditions are suitable for PMWE, e.g.
electron precipitation to enhance the D-region and/or if PMWE has been observed
in other radars like Esrad and Maarsy.
