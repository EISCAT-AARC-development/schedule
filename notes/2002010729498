notes
The purpose of this experiment is to provide a set of background ionospheric 
data with which to test the validity of the inversion of radio occultation  
observations from the CHAMP satellite. The UHF Radar will be employed to scan the geographic meridian from north to south using the tau2 pulse scheme. The  
intervals booked have been chosen to coincide with occasions when the CHAMP  
satellite is close to the Mainland Radars. During these periods, the Tromso  
dynasonde will need to be in operation so that the incoherent scatter data can  
be calibrated.
