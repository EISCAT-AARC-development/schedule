notes
March 2008 is a very interesting month, with Cluster moving towards its best 
cusp configuration, while good THEMIS tail conjunctions continue on the 
nightside.

Using a similar philosophy as in February, I am requesting two periods of 
coverage for THEMIS from 22-04 UT on March 4/5 and 16/17.  These are two 
periods when THEMIS is conjugate with the US sector, but when observations of 
substorm effects in the European sector would be particularly valuable.

I am also asking for support for a dayside conjunction of Cluster from 06-12 UT 
on March 20th, and a longer interval from 00 to 10 UT on March 25th, which 
includes a 4-spacecraft THEMIS tail conjunction and a Cluster cusp conjunction.

The ideal mode is low-elevation northward-pointing VHF along boresight, using 
tau1, and a LowElNorth mode on the ESR using tau0, with 4:1 interleaving 
between the 32m and 42m dishes.
