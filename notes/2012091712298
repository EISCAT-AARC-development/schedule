notes
A full IPS observational programme will be specified nearer the time.  ESR, if
repaired, will be essential to the observing plan.  In addition, maximum
available badwidth at all sites is needed, and 1420MHz (with full wide-band
receivers in both cases) at the remote sites if VHF is not in place by then -
VHF would be preferable over 1420MHx for more-direct comparisons with KAIRA and
LOFAR and also with the ESR.
