notes
This is a UK experiment from UCL to investigate what mechanism(s) cause
upwelling of the atmosphere in the polar regions and the consequent patches of
increased density. Radar observations are required to coincide with optical
measurements so clear, dark skies are needed. Results will be compared with
polar cap observations and feed into modelling studies.
8 hours of actual observing time are available , which translates to 2 runs. We
are over scheduling slightly to account for the need for dark, cloudless skies.
Experiment to be run in conjunction with KAIRA
