notes
 We will investigate anisotropy of the F-region ion temperature 
in the latitudes near the polar cap boundary, and the dayside 
polar cap by using beams of the EISCAT-UHF radar and the ESR with 
different aspect angles pointed toward the north and the south, 
respectively.
 Anisotropy of the F-region ion temperature depends upon collision 
models (polarization type, charge-exchange type, Coulomb collision) 
as well as on a strength of the electric field.
 In the latitude range around the polar cap boundary and the dayside 
polar cap, the convective electric filed shows a large variability 
in time and space. It is valuable to derive anisotropy of the F-region 
ion temperature in these region.
