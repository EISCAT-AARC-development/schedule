notes
To determine unambiguously the height-resolved neutral-wind-compensated 
electrodynamics of an auroral arc at meso-scale resolution, in particular the 
local spatial distribution of Joule heating and field-aligned currents in the 
vicinity of an auroral arc. To determine the E-region neutral wind response 
time to ion drag as a function of plasma density. The SCANDI will provide 
neutral wind measurements in the E- and F-layers. The ESR will be scanned in 
azimuth angle at a continuous rate sequentially at 3 elevation angles to match 
the SCANDI sectors.  Clear sky is required. Cancellations are anticipated. The 
ESR will run a standard code on both dishes, i.e. folke.
