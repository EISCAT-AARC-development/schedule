notes
This is a a joint experiment between the UK, Sweden and Norway to provide EISCAT
observations in support of the CLUSTER spacecraft as they traverse the southern
hemisphere cusp. Five intervals have been selected, each run lasting four hours
(minimum time for radar operation).

The time contributed by the three partners is:
Norway: 12 hours
Sweden: 12 hours
UK: 12 hours (ESR), 24 hours (mainland)

Although we are requesting 4-hour slots the experiment only really needs about 2
hours. Thus if other experimenters request overlapping time we could come to an
agreement to reduce the time that may be scheduled for CCOC.

The VHF will be operated pointing at low elevation to the north (potential time
split: UK(4),NO(8), SW(8))
The UHF will be operated at low elevation pointing generally north-west to
provide wider cusp coverage and 2D velocity estimates in conjunction with the
VHF (potential time split: UK(20))
The ESR 32m dish will point at low elevation to the north, interleaved with the
42m dish n(potential time split: NO(4), SW(4), UK(12))
This configuration will optimise the chances of observing features in the Cusp
to provide context and interhemispheric comparison with the CLUSTER satellites.
All partners will have equal access to all of the data taken.
