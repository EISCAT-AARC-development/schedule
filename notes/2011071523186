notes
We want to study PMSE and thin layers in the D-region/lower E-region with using
the 42m antenna (field aligned) and the 32m antenna with complementary code
program and 90 m range resolution for interferometric observations. The 32m dish
should be adjusted in vertical position or tilted 7 degees perpendicular to the
42m dish. Desired altitude is 60 to 140 km with a high time and altitude
resolution. Prefered measuring time is 0700 - 1300 UT. The overlap with the
heating campaign will be considered and is already discussed and agreed. In this
case the heating experiment has priority.
