notes
We will continue studies of phenomena in the F-region of the ionosphere (plasma 
parameters, artificial field-aligned irregularities, HF-induced optical 
emissions) induced by powerful HF radio waves with X-mode polarization when the 
heater frequency is equal or above the critical frequency of the F2 layer. The 
main attention will be paid to the comparison between the phased array 1 and 3. 
We also plan to study the gyro harmonic effects under the X-mode heating.  
Experiments will be carried out from 18 October to 3 November 2013 every day 
from 12 to 18 UT under quite magnetic conditions by using the HF heating 
facility (HEA) and Tromso UHF radar (TRO). It is expected that the observations 
at Tromso will be supported by the CUTLASS (Leicester University, UK) and by 
optical observations (IRF, Kiruna, Sweden and the Tromso University, Norway). 
The experiments to be cancelled due to unsuitable ionospheric conditions.
