notes
Radar, radio, and optical observations of naturally-enhanced emissions (ion-acoustic, Langmuir, radio, and 
optical waves) conducted near local midnight and/or during satellite passes.  ISR data will be recording 
using 32-m vertical and 42-m field-aligned simultaneously, using both IL and PL channels on both 
antennas.  A new control program will be used for this purpose.  Radio emission data will be recorded 
using a wide-band (0-10 MHz) receiver provided by Dartmouth College operating at the KHO. Optical data 
will be recorded by collaborating instruments on Svalbard.

In this case Cassiope/ePOP is expected to pass at or near field-aligned at 22:28:52 UT on 20141109, at 
22:22:51 UT on 20141110, at 22:16:46 UT on 20141111, at 22:10:39 UT on 20141112, and at 22:10:31 
UT on 20141113.  However it is a low orbit (340 km) and in three or four weeks from the date of this 
request (20141010) the time or even the date of the passes might shift, so if permitted an adjustment of 
operating times might be helpful perhaps a week before the passes.
