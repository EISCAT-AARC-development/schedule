notes
I am submitting two nightside Cluster experiments, in response to a request 
from Anita Aikio, who is interested to try and capture data during auroral 
perigee passes using the improved programs now available on the EISCAT 
radars.  Anita points out that perigee passes have not been as well covered as 
the cusp passes which occur in this phase of the mission.  The two intervals 
are: March 1st 2100 - 0300 (2nd) and March 13th 1900 - 0100 (14th).
