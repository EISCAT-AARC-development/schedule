notes
Main objective of this rocket campaign is to study the upper atmospheric dynamics and energetics in 
the lower thermosphere accompanied with the auroral activity. In this campaign, rocket- borne 
instruments and two remote (ground-based) facilities will be simultaneously operated as explained 
below: 1. Measurements of neutral atmospheric temperature and density, the auroral emission rate, and 
the  electron temperature and density by the rocket-borne instruments. 2. Measurements of the ion 
drift, temperature and density as well as electron temperature and 
density by EISCAT radar 3. Measurements of the neutral wind and temperature by the ground-based 
Fabry-Perot  Interferometer (FPI).  We will run CP-2 mode with 12 hrs per day during the campaign 
period.  So, if necessary, we like to  shift operation hours by up to 4 hrs.
