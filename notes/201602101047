notes
We run CP2 for 45 hours (as a SP) after the 135 hrs CP2 run, so that make long run data of 180 hrs (7.5 
days) appropriate for tide and Q2DW study in the lower thermosphere in winter time. Sodium LIDAR, MR, 
and MF radar will be operated as well at Tromso.  Collaborations between Japan, Norway, and Sweden.
