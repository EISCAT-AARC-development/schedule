notes
The experiment target is the observation of Jupiter's synchrotron radiation  
(JSR) at 930MHz. We plan to make following experiments in this October,  
1. Investigation of sky-temperature by a sky-tipping method.  
2. Investigation of galactic noise and environmental radio noise.  
3. 10-hour(one Jupiter rotation period) continuous monitor of JSR by     
    trackingJupiter.  
We make a small campaign from October 23 to October 26.  
PI is Dr H. Misawa, who will be at the Tromso site during the experiment.
