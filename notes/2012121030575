Study of Travelling Ionospheric Disturbances and their connection with neutral wind variations. The aim 
is to try to catch a similar event as observed on Jan 20 2010, and analyse it similarly for TIDs from the 
EISCAT results directly, and for neutral winds using the technique from Oulu University. The results can 
be compared with TEC estimates from the GeoTrim GPS network. In the January 2010 event, TRO UHF 
recorded TID signatures, and TEC estimates also showed some wave fronts. In TEC data however, 
several wave front directions were superposed, which makes the analysis somewhat challenging. With 
the new campaign we hope to catch (a) clearer event(s).
