This is a a UK experiment to provide EISCAT observations in support of the 
CLUSTER spacecraft as they traverse the southern hemisphere cusp. Two intervals 
have been selected for April 2014, (one each accounted to the CCOC and CSCS 
allocations) each run lasting four hours (the minimum time for a single radar 
operation).

Although we are requesting 4-hour slots the experiment only really needs about 2
hours. Thus if any other experimenters request overlapping time we could come to 
an agreement to reduce the time that may be charged to the UK.

The experiment configuration should be the same as used in the CCOC experiments 
of April and May 2013: 

The VHF will be operated pointing at low elevation to the north 
The UHF will be operated at low elevation pointing generally north-west to
provide wider cusp coverage and 2D velocity estimates in conjunction with the
VHF 
The ESR 32m dish will point at low elevation to the north, interleaved with 
observations on the 42m dish.

This configuration will optimise the chances of observing features in the Cusp
to provide context and interhemispheric comparison with the CLUSTER satellites.
