notes
This experiment is intended to provide radar support for the new Svalbard 
Scanning Doppler Imager (SCANDI) instrument belonging to UCL, which is now 
installed in the Adventdalen observatory.

These experiments will use the standard ESR CP2.  Clear conditions are 
required, hence three runs have been requested to allow some flexibility - it 
is intended to run these experiments on two nights.

The requested slot runs from 21 to 07 UT on each of three nights (Feb 3/4, 4/5 
and 5/6) immediately preceding the long CP2 run.
