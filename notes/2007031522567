notes
In March 2007, the orbit plane of Cluster comes close to the Sun-Earth line, 
making this the optimum interval for studying cusp sector conjunctions. 

We are requesting coverage for four Cluster cusp conjunctions when Cluster is 
close to magnetic conjugacy with EISCAT/ESR.  These are essentially the best 
cusp conjunctions of the year, and so ideally need coverage from both the ESR 
and the mainland.  The times are as follows:

March 3   08-12 UT
March 10  09-13 UT
March 15  06-10 UT
March 22  08-12 UT

In addition we are requesting coverage for three perigee passes (two nightside, 
one dayside) as follows:

March 7  20-24  UT
March 19 19-23 UT
March 29 09-13 UT

The usual configuration of the ESR experiments requires that there is an 
interleaving (typically 4:1) between low elevation observations on the 32m dish 
and field-aligned observations on the 42m.  As such, the existing ESR/Cluster 
experiments should also satisfy the cadence requirement on field-aligned 
observations for the IPY run at the ESR.

The ESR/Cluster runs should fit well with the ethos of the long IPY experiment, 
but an essential requirement is the pointing of the 32m dish in LowElNorth mode.
