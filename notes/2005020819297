notes
These experiments are intended to support the calibration and validation of 
DMSP GUVI imager by detecting auroral boundaries during overpasses of the 
satellite. The satellite is in a sun-synchronous orbit, so that overpasses of 
EISCAT always occur in the evening sector at around 17 and 19 UT.  The 
experiment needs dark conditions with no moonlight, but there is no need for 
cloud-free conditions, because the auroral imaging is done from above.  

Please note that the times quoted may be approximate.
