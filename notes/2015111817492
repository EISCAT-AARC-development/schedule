notes
The main purpose is to study the magnetic zenith effect during ordinary mode HF pumping of the quiet 
ionospheric plasma, especially possible L-mode propagation to bring about the self focusing of the 
pump wave. The pump frequency needs to be below the ionospheric critical frequency. The experiments 
are supported by optical measurements of the ALIS system (IRF, Kiruna). In the event of not too intense 
auroral activity, pump-induced perturbations in the vicinity of auroral arcs will be attempted.
