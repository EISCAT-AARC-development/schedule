notes
This experiment is aimed to conduct coordinated observation on dynamics of 
cusp and ¡®bright spots¡¯ auroras with EISCAT Svalbard radar and multi-
wavelength monochromatic all-sky CCD imagers at Ny-Alesund. Interested time 
window is from 1000 to 1600 in MLT (or 0700-1300 in UT). The ESR steerable 
antenna will be operated in a azimuth scanning mode, sweeping 120¢ªeastward 
from its magnetic north at an elevation of 45¢ª in 192 sec. The monochromatic 
all-sky CCD imaging system at Ny-Alesund will continuously measure 2-D 
intensity distributions of targeted auroras on 427.8nm, 557.7nm and 630.0nm at 
a sampling rate of a frame every 6 seconds.
