notes
This is a meridian-scanning experiment in support of ionospheric tomography 
observations, using the Aberystwyth chain of beacon satellite receivers.  The 
timing (18-24 UT) is chosen to allow the observation of nightside processes.

Two intervals are scheduled, but only one will be run, with the other being 
cancelled. The chosen dates (March 24 and 26) reflect the availability of 
suitable satellites.
