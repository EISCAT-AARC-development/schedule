CHAMP-CL (01-14 Oct 2006)
The campaign intends to study thermospheric upwelling in the substorm currrent
wedge zone prior to or around local midnight during conjunctions of the CHAMP
and (hopefully, but not necessarily, simultaneous) Cluster satellites with the
radar ionospheric observation volume. Some substorm activity would be desirable
to observe noticable density changes with CHAMP's accelerometer together with
electrodynamic parameters.
The request is preliminary, and subject to more precise orbit predictions of
both CHAMP and Cluster about one month prior to the campaign. It is overbooked,
i.e. cancellations will be done, because only nearby (more closer) satellite
passages will be actually used, which are expected about every second day.
