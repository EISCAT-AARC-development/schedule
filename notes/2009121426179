Delay-Doppler Observations of the Ionospheric Plasma

At present the spatial resolution of EISCAT observations in the plane
perpendicular to the antenna beam is limited by the beam width. This is
for the UHF about 1 km (half power beam width) in the E region (100 km
height), and 3 km in the F region (300 km height). Optical recordings of
the aurora reveal a wealth of structure at smaller scales, and also the
magnetic field seen by low orbiting satellites (CHAMP) indicates that
currents over sub-kilometer scales are flowing. Therefore radar
observations of electric field/plasma convection at scales of less than
a kilometer would be scientifically valuable.

High spatial resolution can be achieved along the beam with coding
techniques. Thus one can in principle achieve the required resolution by
tilting the beam away from the magnetic fields lines. One problem is
that in the F region the IS spectrum is too wide in order to use
pulse-to-pulse coding, and in long pulse coding the spectrum becomes
unresolved if spatial resolution is squeezed to less than 1 km at all
time lags. However, in order to observe electric field/plasma
convection, one really only needs Doppler information, not the full
spectrum. In order words, one needs to measure the autocorrelation only
at time lags which can be much shorter than the correlation time of the
IS signal. The corresponding technique called delay-Doppler has been
successfully used in planetary radar applications (eg, Harmon et al,
JGR, 104, 14065-14089, 1999). It originates itself from the long pulse
coding method done in ionospheric (IS) radar.

We plan to use a special code suitable for delay-Doppler developed by
Ingemar Häggström with 0.6km/1.6s resolution. The antenna beam will be
tilted to around 45 deg elevation. 

We use 20 accounted hours of Swedish time for the EISCAT ESR.  
The time of radar operations is 4 hours on each of five days in
December 2009.
