notes
The UHF radar will be operated field-aligned running the standard beata 
programme.

These schedule entries are made on the basis that the runs will only be charged 
for two hours of operation, not four hours and that there will be flexibility 
regarding cancellation. If this will not be the case, the request may need to 
be revised!

The experiment requires low geomagnetic activity and clear skies for optical 
observations, so cancellation is expected.
