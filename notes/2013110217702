notes
(The HTVIT PP runs are additionaly requested because 
of quiet ionosphere between 17 and 25 October.)

EROS commands:
run /kst/exp/ni/beata/beata fm sweep8032s
enablerec


In order to investigate rapid variations of plasma 
parameters inside/outside ionospheric trough during 
storm/substorm, we conduct the EISCAT special 
observations with high speed meridional scan which 
takes only 60 seconds from 32 to 80 degrees. 
It is preferable to run the observations under 
disturbed geomagnetic condition.
