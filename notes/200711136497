notes
This proposal requests EISCAT time to support Rosetta observations of the 
magnetotail during the 2nd Earth gravity assist, closest approach occurring on 
13th November 2007.  In the week leading up to closest approach, Rosetta will 
approach the Earth from the nightside, encountering the magnetotail at 
distances of several hundred RE downstream of the planet.  Deep tail encounters 
at such distances have not occurred since ISEE3 passed through the tail during 
manoeuvres on its way to Comet Giacobini-Zinner in 1982/3.  

We wish to optimise the radar operating mode to detect the occurrence of 
substorms and diagnose the ionospheric flow during substorms.  We propose that 
the mainland EISCAT VHF and UHF radars point polewards at low elevation (30°) 
to cover the auroral latitude range from northern Norway to Svalbard, where 
substorm signatures are most expected to observed.  The two should be separated 
in azimuthal pointing direction, so that beam-swung vectors of the plasma flow 
can be determined.  At the ESR the 42 m dish should make field-aligned 
measurements, consistent with IPY requirements.  There are two options for the 
32 m dish: if the SNR of the mainland radars is sufficient to allow high 
quality measurements of plasma flow to be made all the way to Svalbard, then 
the ESR 32 m dish should point polewards at low elevation to make measurements 
in the polar cap; alternatively, it should point equatorwards at low elevation 
to complete coverage of auroral latitudes.  This decision will be made as the 
experiment is run and conditions are known.

We request 6 hours (18-24 UT) on 7 nights (7-13 November 2007), totalling 84 
hours on the mainland radar and 42 hours on the ESR 32 m dish.  The experiments 
will be carried out in collaboration with Sweden, with both parties 
contributing an equal amount of time.  If less than the full amount of time is 
awarded we would reduce our operations on the nights of November 7th-9th when 
no particle instrument data will be available from Rosetta.
