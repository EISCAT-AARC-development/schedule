notes
PoGOLite is a balloon-borne astrophysical experiment, designed to measure the
polarization of soft gamma rays with energies between 25 keV and 80 keV. The
pathfinder mission will be launched from Esrange near Kiruna between 10 August
and 5 September 2010. A coordinated ground-based campaign is planned to support
the PoGOLite experiment. Two sessions are required, one early radar run for
testing the experiment, and one session during the balloon flight. The proposed
experiments to run are either Manda, arc_dlayer, or special SGO designed
experiment. 
Booked times until the balloon launch (apart from the test run) will be
cancelled based on the launch prospects.
