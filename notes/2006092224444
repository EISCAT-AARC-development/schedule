notes
September is the best month for Cluster tail conjunctions, and we have selected 
four good conjunctions for storm/substorm studies when Cluster is close to 
magnetic conjugacy with EISCAT and in the tail - the aim is to be within a few 
hours of a neutral sheet crossing.  In addition we have also requested a cusp 
sector perigee pass on the 22nd.

The conjunctions generally occur south of ESR but north of the mainland sites, 
so an optimum orientation for all except the perigee pass would be to use 
LowElSouth at the ESR with northward looking VHF boresight tau1 at Tromso.  A 
northward-looking beam on the UHF would be an acceptable replacement if the VHF 
was unavailable (e.g. for klystron bake-out).  For the perigee pass on the 
22nd, LowElNorth would be more suitable on the ESR, with boresight beam on the 
mainland VHF.

The conjunctions on the 3rd, 10th and 15th fall within the ESR dish maintenance 
period.  If the ESR 32m dish is unavailable, data from the 42m dish would still 
be useful.  The conjunctions on the 22nd fall within the period requested for a 
CP (CP3).   If this period is not available because of the CP, an acceptable 
alternative would be 20-24 UT on September 8th.
