notes
Radar echoes known as Naturally Enhanced Ion Acoustic Lines (neials) with 
intensities several orders of magnitude above thermal levels have been found in 
the auroral ionosphere up to altitudes of about 1600 km. The auroral electrons 
give rise to Langmuir waves through instabilities when they pass through the 
plasma above the aurora. The Langmuir waves then decay into ion acoustic waves, 
which are detected by the radar. 
We plan to search for enhanced ion acoustic lines in the altitude range of 1500-
3000 km using the Eiscat heating facility as a radar. We shall monitor the 
ionospheric conditions at the footpoint of the same field line using the Eiscat 
uhf radar and observe optical emissions with the Auroral Large Imaging System 
(ALIS).
