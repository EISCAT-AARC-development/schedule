A study of short-term variations in polar mesosphere summer echoes (PMSE) and 
noctilucent clouds (NLC) is proposed involving the EISCAT UHF and VHF active 
radars and the University of Bath's meteor radar at ESRANGE. This is linked to 
the current UK STFC grant PP/E002218/1 "Dynamics and coupling of the mesosphere 
and lower thermosphere - studies with meteor radar and EISCAT".  In particular, 
we will investigate the dynamical conditions and meteor fluxes, affecting the 
strength of PMSE.
