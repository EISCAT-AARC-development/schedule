notes
We are interested to observe the transition period between PMWE and PMSE
Running simultaneously with VHF and UHF Tromsø (TRO)
Using MANDA pulse configuration
From 08:00 to 12:00 UT
The operation of EISCAT radars and HF Heating will be conditional on the existence of echoes, which will 
be monitored with MORRO radar.
