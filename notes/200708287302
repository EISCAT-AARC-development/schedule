notes
In August, the Cluster apogee goes from ~ 04 - 02 MLT (so perigee is ~16- 14). 
At the beginning of the month there are passes skimming the dawn flank MP while 
at the end of the month the spacecraft may start encountering the current sheet 
at apogee and the dayside cusp at perigee.

I have selected four nightside conjunctions for coverage with EISCAT as follows:

August 09-10  23-03 UT
August 14-15  23-03 UT
August 21-22  22-02 UT
August 28-29  22-02 UT

For these nightside passes, the optimum mode is LowElSouth on the ESR, running 
tau0, and northward-looking tau1 on the VHF using the low elevation boresight 
beam (assuming that only one klystron is available).

The orbit geometry is such that Sondrestrom can continue to track Cluster after 
these passes as the footprint moves west across Greenland, so co-ordinated 
Sondrestrom operations will be requested for some of these passes.
