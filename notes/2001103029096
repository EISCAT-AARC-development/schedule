notes
The planned time table of the welding work of the cracks in the UHF   
antenna%92s   
structure is  as follows:   
   
29.10  Travel to Sodankyla   
30.10  Welding work at Sodankyl%E4   
31.10  Travel to Kiruna   
1.11   Welding work at Kiruna   
2.11   Travel to Tromso   
3.11   Welding work at Tromso   
4.11   "back home"   
   
The time table may shift one day!   
Tromso work is optional (the final decision will be done next week)!   
According Gudmund we set the highest priority for the welding   
work  (i.e. no UHF experiment during "the welding days"!!!
