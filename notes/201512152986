notes
This is a joint experiment using EISCAT and RISR-C to track polar patches across
the polar cap.
The aim is to observe the same patches at different locations and at different
times. These observations will be used to determine:
1) The reaction rate for the decay of the polar cap plasma.
2)Changes in the large-scale plasma structures within the polar cap patch.

ESR 32m will observe northwards at low elevation (El=30, Az=0)
The ESR 42m should observe along the geomagnetic field line
The VHF should observe northwards at low elevation (El=30, Az=0)
RISR-C should observe at 25 points in a 5 x 5 grid, in the same manner as
described in Dahlgren et al. (2012).

Two evening runs are required

In terms of the transmission codes:
ESR: tau0, with one dump on the ESR-42m followed by four dumps on the ESR-32m 
EISCAT VHF: tau8
RISR-C:  The same transmission code as described in Dahlgren et al. (2012). 
This was a long-pulse experiment with the radar observing using a 5 x 5 beam grid.

The final decision on coding used will be confirmed closer to the time
