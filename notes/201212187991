Request is made to further study enhanced ion acoustic spectra, both produced in
heating experiments and naturally occurring. 

The request is made for four evenings with heating, Dec 4-7, 17-23 UT, and 11
evenings, Dec 8-18, of UHF radar alone (17-24). 

Observations with heating will run independent of optical conditions at Tromsö.
Observations of natural aurora include overbooking, and some time will be
cancelled depending on the weather and activity level. A choice of two
experiments will be used, either field-aligned, to be used with imagers on site
(planned to be deployed by SWRI), or scanning over Esrange (as the October
SPIDER12 experiment), depending on what is the most likely to return interesting
data.
