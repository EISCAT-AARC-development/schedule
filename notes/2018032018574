notes
We aim at investigating variations of ion temperature and electric field in the F-region (Thermosphere) in 
order to understand more deeply the basic state of the polar Thermosphere as well as the coupling 
between Magnetosphere-Ionosphere-Thermosphere in the polar region. We run the Tromso UHF radar and 
ESR. 
PI is Prof Fujiwara.   We have requested the SP for 3 days (March 20-22), but we will run for only two days 
out of the 3  days.
