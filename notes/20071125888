notes
During November 2007, the Cluster orbit plane moves progressively away from the 
plane of the magnetotail until by the end of the month it crosses the dusk 
flank almost orthogonal to the Sun-Earth line.  This is not one of the most 
interesting periods, but the main scientific interest in this month seems to be 
in possible flank-skimming orbits (toward the beginning of the month) and flank-
crossing orbits (toward the end).

Unfortunately none of the flank-skimming periods appear to be in the right 
time/longitude sector for studies with EISCAT.  I am requesting one flank-
crossing interval, from 07-11 UT on November 25th, when Cluster nominally 
exists the magnetopause just east of Svalbard.

The best configuration for this experiment is the standard mode with the ESR 
32m dish in LowElNorth configuration and dumps interleaved 4:1 with the 42m 
dish, which also satsifies the requirements of the IPY run.

The VHF radar should be used in low elevation mode at 30 degrees elevationa 
long boresight, running tau1.

In the case of conflict with Special Programmes or scheduled maintenance 
periods, this experiment should be given a relatively low priority.
