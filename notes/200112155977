notes
Many properties of the Polar Cap Ionospheric Patches (PCIP) are known, but 
their origin is at best poorly understood.  Several mechanisms have been  
proposed for the formation of polar cap patches.  The critical question is to 
find out which one(s) dominate(s).  We also aim to study how polar cap sun- 
aligned arcs terminate at theeir dayside extreme.  With the fast sweep modes on 
ESR-1 we successfully mapped polar cap patches in January 2001.  In December we 
want to advance our experiment by operating EISCAT VHF in low elevation split- 
beam configuration over Svalbard for identification of the polar cap boundary 
and provision of plasma flow dynamics.  The experiment will be supported by the  
optical observations from Longyearbyen Svalbard and CUTLASS.  ESR-1 will be 
operated in a set of different modes appropriate for the actual geophysical 
activity level.
