notes
This experiment is a collaboration between the UK and Germany. It will require the UHF Radar and the Heater, and will be carried out in collaboration with        
optical measurements. The experiment will employ the CP1 pulse code for the UHF Radar, but with the antennas for part of the time stationary and for the        
remainding time in a scanning mode.
