notes
POLITE  
     POLITE aims to advance our understanding of topside light ion morphology and dynamics through a combination of  
     modeling efforts and coordinated observations by the ISR chain and by DMSP satellite overflights. The use of the full  
     latitudinal and longitudinal extent of the ISR chain is critical to the campaign, as one key objective is the study of the  
     latitudinal and longitudinal variations of hydrogen, oxygen, and helium ions. Simultaneous measurements of neutral  
     oxygen, hydrogen, and helium are also important, in order to explore the coupling between ionic and neutral species  
     in the lower topside. The helium ion layer descends in altitude and increases in strength during the wintertime,  
     making observation easier for the ISR chain. Significant asymmetries in field-aligned flows are also at their  
     maximums during summer and winter solstices. IMF support is not very important, but new moon periods are critical  
     since optical support is required for simultaneous neutral species measurements.
