notes
February 2005 sees the beginning of the fourth Cluster cusp campaign, as the 
orbit plane rotates back into the Sun-Earth line by the end of the month.  We 
are requesting three intervals of potential Cluster/cup conjunctions in the 
vicinity of EISCAT.  March will see better conjunctions, as the overpasses 
will occur at earlier local times.
