notes
This experiment will investigate the Neutral Atmosphere Flywheel Effect, by        
which substorm energy is stored in the neutral atmosphere. It will employ the         
UHF and VHF Radars on the Mainland and both Svalbard antennas. The VHF Radar         
must be operated in dual beam mode. The pulse codes are tau0 on the ESR, tau1 on the VHF Radar and tau2 on the UHF Radar. The experiment requires active        
conditions. Two intervals have been booked, but only one will be used. The        
second is intended as a backup should the experiment not run on the first.
