For February 2008, we are requesting experiments which concentrate on 
supporting the THEMIS tail campaign.  This is the optimum month for THEMIS tail 
studies, with the four THEMIS spacecraft being aligned along the magnetotail at 
intervals of four days.

After consulting the Ground-Based Working Group, I am requesting four intervals 
of EISCAT operation during which four THEMIS spacecraft are in conjunction with 
instruments on the Eastern coast of North America. Note that four-spacecraft 
conjunctions do not occur over Scandinavia. The aim of the EISCAT observations 
is to detect the spread of substorm signatures from the US to the European 
sector at this time.  These intervals are from 22-04 UT on February 13/14, 
17/18, 21/22 and 25/26.  Such conjunctions occur every four days, but I have 
concentrated on periods later in the month to avoid a conflict with the NEMI 
rocket campaign.

I am also requesting one period of operations from 17-23 UT on February 19th, 
when there is a three-spacecraft conjunction over the European sector, at a 
time slot much more suited to the direct observation of substorm effects at 
EISCAT.

The optimum mode for these experiments would be tau1 at the VHF, looking 
northward at 30 degrees elevation along boresight, and tau0 at the ESR using 
LowElSouth mode and 4:1 interleaving between the 32m and 42m dishes.
