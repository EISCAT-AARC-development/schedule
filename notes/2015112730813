notes
This experiment is a conjunction of the Cassiope satellite with the direction of the Heating beam at 12:00 
UT. The main purpose is to study the magnetic zenith effect during ordinary mode HF pumping of the 
quiet ionospheric plasma, especially possible L-mode propagation to bring about the self focusing of the 
pump wave. The pump frequency needs to be below the ionospheric critical frequency.
