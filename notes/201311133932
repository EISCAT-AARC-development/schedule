notes
We plan to continue studies of contrasting O/X-mode heating phenomena in the F-
 region of the polar ionosphere induced by SPEAR heating facility in the 
frame  of UNIS-AARI SPEAR project.  Experiments will be carried out from 13 
November to 20 November from 09 to 13 UT with using the SPEAR heating facility 
and Svalbard radar (ESR). The experiments to be cancelled due to unsuitable 
ionospheric conditions.
