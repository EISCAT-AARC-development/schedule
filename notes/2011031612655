notes
This study is to repeat experiments done at the mainland site with the Tromsø
heater and UHF radar. Here we use the ESR in conjunction with the SPEAR heater.
We plan to study contrasting O/X-mode heating effects in the over- and
underdense ionospheric F region.
The behavior of artificial small-scale field-aligned irregularities will be
investigated in combination with electron density and temperature and ion
velocities measurements.
The results will then be compared to similar experiment which have been recently
carried out at Tromsø.
The beata experiment will be used.
