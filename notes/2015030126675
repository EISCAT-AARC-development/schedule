notes
This is a request for joint UHF/VHF experiments in connection with 
observations of radio absorption and polarimetry rotation at KAIRA in 
Kilpisjarvi.  The request is essentially a repeat of observations made in 
2013, using a modified pointing geometry.  The experiment needs active 
conditions.  Hence three intervals are being requested, but probably only one 
of these will actually be run.
