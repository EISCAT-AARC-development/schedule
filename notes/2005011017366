notes
We want to be scheduled as second priority and to other experiments or to maintenance 
during the working day, and to any other experiments which happen to be scheduled 
during nighttime. For the weekend,  15/16 January, we would like to be scheduled for 
daytime operations at first priority if no other experiments are scheduled then. We want to 
run actively when one of the following conditions is fulfilled 
1) PMWE are observed with the ESRAD radar
2) the Magic rocket is launched
3) the Magic rocket has been launched the previous night
