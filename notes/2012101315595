notes
We will continue studies of phenomena in the F-region of the ionosphere induced 
by powerful HF radio waves with X-mode polarisation when the heater frequency 
is above the critical frequency of the F2 layer under power stepping of the HF 
heater. We also plan to study the gyro harmonic effects under the X-mode 
heating.The phased array 1 resulting in ERP = 600 - 1200 MW will be used in the 
course of experiments. Experiments will be carried out from 12 October to 22 
October every day from 13 to 18 UT by using the HF heating facility (HEA) and 
Tromso UHF radar (TRO). The experiments to be cancelled due to unsuitable 
ionospheric conditions.
