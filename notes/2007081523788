notes
According to current knowledge, under moderate conditions, the dayside boundary 
layers (LLBL/cusp/mantle) can be observed with the EISCAT Svalbard Radar from 
06-12 MLT. In earlier winter experiments we have been able to resolve narrow 
flow channels in the cusp. One category of these, named reversed flow events 
(RFEs-reversed by means of opposite to the magnetic tension force) may be 
interpreted as a signature of Birkeland current arcs and low E-region 
conductivity during winter cusp conditions. However if they are, RFEs should 
not exist during sunlit conditions.  We would like to test this working 
hypothesis by one week operation of the Fast Azimuth Scan Mode at daytime.
