notes
We will be operating the EISCAT HEATING 
facility and the UHF Radar at Tromso.  We will be setting up our SEE 
receivers at three sites.  This is for the SEEIT experiment.
We need to make Ne, Te, Ti mesurements in the heated volume.  We are 
interested in ion-line and plasma-line profiles, as well as time histories 
of the plasma and ion line spectra.
