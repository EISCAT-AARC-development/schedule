notes
For January 2005, the Cluster orbit apogee is moving into the dayside, with a 
number of crossings of the dayside magnetopause.  We selected three candidate 
intervals (Jan 18th 08-14 UT, Jan 25th 09-15 UT and Jan 6th 10-16 UT) during 
which magnetic conjunctions with EISCAT occur close to outbound crossings of 
the dayside magnetopause.  Of these, two will be selected in such a way as to 
avert any clash with the French campaign.
