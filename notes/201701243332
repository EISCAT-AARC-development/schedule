We conduct coordinated observations of various auroras with the EISCAT radar 
and ground-based optical imagers, to investigate small-scale aurora and also 
develop a method for estimating characteristic energy of pulsating auroral
electrons. 
We will run the SP only when it is clear sky and geomagnetic condition is active.
