notes
This request is part of the international support for the CAPER and C-REX rocket 
launches, which will use time contributed by Norway (RetRFE), UK (this booking) 
and Jim LaBelle's third party CAPER allocation.  Decisions about what mode to run 
will be made on the day of launch, according to weather conditions and launch 
priorities at Andoya.
