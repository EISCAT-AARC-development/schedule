notes
This EISCAT schedule request is submitted for the SCRAP experiment launch campaign. 
During this days the SCRAP experiment will be launched from Esrange on the REXUS 
rocket. 20 hours have been allocated for SCRAP in the EISCAT peer review program.
The possible days for the launch are: from March the 17th to March the 24th; the launch 
window during the launch days opens at 6:00 local time and closes at 16:00 local time. 
During this campaign the EISCAT UHF radar will be used to collect the data for the SCRAP 
experiment. The UHF radar will be used in a low elevation mode looking over the Esrange 
rocket range. 
After the rocket launch, when the metal dust is released from the rocket, a scan pattern 
covering the location of the rocket apogee will be run: the location of the apogee is 
expected to at 90 km of altitude above Esrange, corresponding to 154.3 azimuth and 22.5 
elevation from the UHF radar. 
Raw data will be collected and cancellations depending on launch conditions are 
expected.
