notes
During the period 1-15 Agust 2007 there will be an international sounding 
rocket campaign at the Andoya Rocket Range, i.e., the ECOMA-summer campaign 
(ECOMA=Existence and charge state of meteor smoke particles in the middle 
atmosphere). Within this campaign we will launch three payloads with 
instrumentation to measure charged aerosol particles, plasma constituents, 
neutral aerosol particles (photometry and sampling experiments), and turbulence 
parameters. Local measurements of PMSE with an MST radar and measurements with 
the EISCAT VHF and UHF radars will be used for defining the launch criteria. 
Besides their role in the rocket campaign, we intend to study the frequency 
dependence of PMSE. This is particularly interesting since only very few 
examples of PMSE observations in the UHF are available so far.
