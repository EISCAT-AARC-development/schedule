notes
The experiment target is the observation of Jupiter's synchrotron radiation
(JSR), which reflects dynamics of relativistic electrons in Jupiter's
inner magnetosphere. We plan to make the JSR monitoring for about 3 weeks and
5hr a day. In each observation unit, both Jupiter and some flux calibration
stars will be observed with elevational sweeping of the antenna for measuring
atmospheric extinction effect of the earth.
