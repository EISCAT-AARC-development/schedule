notes
EISCAT Kiruna at VHF, EISCAT Sodankyla at 1420MHz with full wide-band receivers in 
both cases, Tromso at 928MHz with as much bandwidth as is available.  ESR at 
500MHz also required.  Tests are planned for the IPS experiment at the new VHF 
frequency at Kiruna along with the ESR and similar VHF-type frequencies on the 
LOFAR system.
