notes
We want to study the dissipation of the electromagnetic energy input from the
magnetosphere and the effect on the thermospheric dynamics. This experiment is
collaborated with our Japanese colleagues who will continue to run the
experiment until 04 UT on 09 Nov 2015 and 06 UT on 12 Nov 2015. The FPI and
optical instruments will be used to observe the neutral wind and auroral activity.

The UHF will be run in CP2 or field-aligned mode which depends on the actual
conditions.

The VHF will be run in tristatic mode with the KIR and SOD receivers.
