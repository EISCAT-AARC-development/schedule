notes
We will perform 3 experiments:
1: Investigation of the role of density striations for L-mode propagation
through the F-layer.
2: Investigation of the role of HF-power for L-mode propagation through the
F-layer and generation of top-side enhancements of ion-acoustic back-scatter.
3: Verification of horizontal variation of electron-heating efficiency.
