notes
The aims of the EASI experiment which require the use of the EISCAT Svalbard
Radar are:
- to study the occurrence and spatial distribution of NEIALs using
interferometry techniques
- to study the energy distribution within and surrounding narrow auroral
forms (especially when associated with NEIALs),
- and to apply the results to theories of NEIAL occurrence and production, and
in general to theories of auroral acceleration processes.

In addition to the ESR, the EASI interferometer arrays and the Auroral Structure
and Kinetics instrument (ASK) will be operated concurrently. 
Radar observations should be made in the field aligned direction and raw data
must be saved. Depending on conditions a standard radar program will run (beata,
arc1, LT4).
