notes
This is the ESR component of a multi-instrument programme of sub-storm 
measurements, proposed by the University of Lancaster.  The precise mode and 
pointing direction will be defined nearer the time of the campaign, but it is 
likely that this experiment will use a standard modulation.

The MISS experiment has an allocation of 36 hours, but is being over-scheduled 
since it depends to some extent on good optical conditions.
