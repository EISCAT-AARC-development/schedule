notes
We plan to continue studies of contrasting O/X-mode heating effects in the over-
and underdense ionosphere F region using the SPEAR heating facility,
specifically the behavior of artificial small-scale field-aligned
irregularities.  The obsverations will form part of a larger campaign which
involves the EISCAT heater and UHF mainland radar.
