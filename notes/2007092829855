notes
This is a combination of three UK (Lancaster University) experiments: GIVE, MZE
and UHLH which have similar requirements regarding ionospheric conditions
(foF2>4 MHz) and time of day.

GIVE UK(30) EI(7.5): stimulation of ion upwelling by HF heating. UHF will run
tau2pl or tau1 tristatic, field-aligned. HF will use a variety of long on/off
periods (~2-8 minutes). 4-hour runs will be performed.

MZE UK(12): comparison of HF heating effects in zenith and magnetic zenith. UHF
will probably run tau2pl, monostatic, field-aligned and vertical. HF will use
short pulses (~5-20 s). 3-hour runs will be performed (09-12 or 10-13 UT).

UHLH UK(25): CUTLASS radar observations of upper- and lower-hybrid waves excited
during HF heating. UHF will probably run tau2pl, monostatic, field aligned. HF
operations to be confirmed, but may require simultaneous operation on two
closely-spaced frequencies. 4-hour runs will be performed.

As indicated above, the remotes will not always be required and will be
cancelled as appropriate. UHLH-mode operations will only be performed when
CUTLASS support is available. Complete cancellation of runs may occur if
ionospheric conditions are unsuitable. We will ensure EISCAT staff are informed
in sufficient time.
