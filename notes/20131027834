notes
In order to investigate rapid variations of plasma 
parameters inside/outside ionospheric trough during 
storm/substorm, we conduct the EISCAT special 
observations with high speed meridional scan which 
takes only 30-40 seconds from 30 to 60 degrees. 
It is preferable to run the observations under 
disturbed geomagnetic condition.

This SP will be conducted after the HTVIT PP run.
