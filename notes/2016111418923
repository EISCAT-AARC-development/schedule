notes
The objective with the HOTTIE (High-altitude O+ Temperature to
Thermosphe-Ionosphe-density Experiment) is to use electron-density and ion and
electron temperature measurements with the VHF and UHF radars combined with
altitude-profiles of ion-velocities with tristatic VHF system to estimate the
neutral densities in the upper thermoshpere. A secondary objective is to use the
VHF and UHF ion-line spectra at E-region altitudes to get estimates of the
collision frequencies. The experiment requires quiet geomagnetic conditions and
will be cancelled if there is a geomagnetically active day
