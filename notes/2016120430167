We conduct coordinated observations of various auroras with the EISCAT radar 
and ground-based optical imagers, to investigate small-scale aurora and also 
develop a method for estimating characteristic energy of pulsating auroral
electrons. 
A clear sky and active geomagnetic condition are desirable.
