notes
A series of POLAR overpasses of Svalbard for this November and December have             
been identified.  These passes will be in the prenoon and premidnight sectors.            
We will use the overflights to establish temporal correlations with the solar            
wind and establish merging and reconnection location relative to 2-dimensional            
patterns from ground based optics and superDARN radar.              
            
We aim to operate EISCAT UHF nd VHF in a 3-beam configuration, equally spaced,             
looking north at 30 degree elevation.  In addition we will direct the ESR-1             
antenna north along the magnetic meridian through Ny-Alesund at 30 degrees            
elevation.             
            
A scientific aim is to validate use of the electron temperature as potential             
tracer of the open closed field line boundary and to look in detail at plasma            
transport across the open-closed field line boundary.  I.e. will identify the            
radar signature of the X-line location, estimate the reconnection rate and            
study temporal and spatial variability of X-line dynamics night and day.  We             
will also use NOAA and DMSP particle data.
