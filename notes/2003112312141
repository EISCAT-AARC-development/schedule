notes
We will make an optical campaign using high resolution aurora cameras
and 4-wavelength photometer with EISCAT UHF radar.
Clear sky and higher geomagnetic activity are desired.
Although we made request for 5 nights, we will run only 3 nights depending on 
conditions.

According to Dr Maarten Blixt, Norway would contribute  6 hrs.
