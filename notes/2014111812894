notes
The purpose of the experiments is to train students and young scientists 
taking part in the School-Conference “Remote Radio Sounding of the 
Ionosphere” ION-2014” which is organized by UiT the Arctic University of 
Norway. The students of this School will be trained in as many aspects of 
the EISCAT radar as possible at the Ramfjord site, in understanding the 
radar experiments and data acquisition, in running experiments and analyzing 
the recorded data. This experiment will also include coordinated runs of 
EISCAT heater and IS radar near Kharkiv (Ukraine) for investigating 
excitation of different types of waves in the ionosphere. The other purpose 
of the experiment is studying the scattering of signals from the EISCAT 
heater at ionospheric irregularities produced by the heater radiation 
itself. To that end we plan to monitor Doppler spectra of the heater signals 
at several greatly dispersed receiving sites, including observation point at 
Ukrainian Antarctic Station.
