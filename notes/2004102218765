notes
October marks the end of the current series of Cluster tail conjunctions.  I 
have suggested four intervals, all co-inciding with Cluster nightside passes 
through the neutral sheet in a region close to magnetic conjugacy with EISCAT.  
The preferred ESR mode would be LowElNorth on the 32m dish interleaved 
(consecutive dumps)with field-aligned observations on the 42m dish, with 
supporting mainland VHF measurements in low-elevation boresight mode.
