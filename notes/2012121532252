notes
The aims of this experiment which require the use of the EISCAT Svalbard Radar 
are:-
   - to study the occurrence and spatial distribution of NEIALs using 
interferometry techniques
   - to study the energy distribution within and surrounding narrow auroral 
forms (especially when associated with NEIALs),
   - and apply the results to theories of NEIAL occurrence and production, and 
in general to theories of auroral acceleration processes.
  The experiment is a collaboration between UK, 20 hours, Norway, 20 hours, and
Sweden, 8 hours, for a total of 48 hours.
  Pulse code LT4FL or beata will be run on the Radar. The experiment will also
employ EASI and ASK.
