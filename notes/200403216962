notes
This experiment is designed to investigate the role of the ion motions in the 
phase velocity of E-region irregularities. The EISCAT tristatic UHF radar will 
be operated in a CP-1-J program performing the ion drift measurements at six E-
region heights as well as providing the ion drift measurements at a single F-
region height of 278 km (twice each 10-min scan). The Doppler velocity 
measurements will be performed at several radar frequencies by the STARE (144 
MHz) and CUTLASS (8, 10, 12, 14, 16, and 18 MHz) Finland radars, the latter to 
be run in a "stereo" mode of operation.
