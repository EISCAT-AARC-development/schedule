notes
Tromso UHF density measurements are requested to support KAIRA ionospheric 
scintillation observations of Cas A at times when KAIRA, Tromso and Cas A are 
closely aligned.  For the best scintillation possibilities, evening observations 
are preferred.  Since the necessary alignment only occurs at specific times and 
is only useful over a short period of time, only 1.5 hours is requested per day.  
The times chosen are attached to other radar requests commencing immediately 
afterwards to enable such a short time request to be accommodated.
