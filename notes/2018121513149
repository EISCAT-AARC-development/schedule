Launching from Poker Flat in January 2018, the DXL sounding rocket will
image the high and mid-altitude cusp with soft X-rays emitted from charge-exchange. EISCAT
will provide the necessary low-altitude constraints on the morphology of the cusp footprint and
convection within the ionosphere. This global picture will provide information of the true spatial
extent, structure, and morphology, which in turn describes how energy and plasma is entering the
magnetosphere from the solar wind.
