notes
Interplanetary scintillation test observations in conjunction with LOFAR and 
KAIRA if available, plus other worldwide sites on a few days (TBD).

Do not panic over the block booking; this is only to indicate days on which we 
may wish to observe.  Exact schedule of observations to be determined.

Kiruna and Sodankyla antennas should be in 1.4GHz mode throughout if possible.
