notes
The UK and Norway are collaborating in a joint optical campaign in conjunction
with the SERSIO rocket campaign. The hours requested will be shared between the
two countries. The UK will run the experiment 'arc' using only the 42 m dish.
Norway will run their interferometry experiment using both dishes. Until the
hours are known for certain we will not decide which experiment runs at which time.
