notes
The key science objective of this experiment is to improve estimates of
meteoroid masses from VHF and UHF radar returns, and in turn, to better estimate
the meteoroid mass flux entering Earth’s atmosphere on a daily basis. We will do
this by first analyzing RCS of meteors measured simultaneously in VHF and UHF,
and using tristatic measurements in UHF. Tristatic UHF will provide the location
of the meteor within the radar beam, so that the RCS can be accurately
estimated. By using RCS measurements at two frequencies and three locations, we
can separately estimate the density and size of meteors. In monostatic and
single-frequency measurements, density and size cannot be separated, and only a
total “line density” can be inferred. Estimated meteor size and density will be
validated against the numerical meteor model of Marshall and Close [2015, in
preparation] which calculates RCS as a function of meteor size, density, and
radar frequency.
