notes
Field-aligned CP1 measurement at both TRO UHF and ESR for monitoring ionospheric response to 
prevailing space weather conditions.

Finnish high school students will visit Nagoya University and Kyoto University/Shigaraki MU radar in order 
to have a one week education on space weather, including an incoherent scatter radar experiment at 
Tromso UHF radar and EISCAT Svalbard radar. Basic field-aligned profiles from the high latitudes will be 
followed in real time and analyzed afterwards, for understanding of ionospheric response in the prevailing 
space weather situation and demonstration of the power of incoherent scatter measurements by the global 
ISR network. Experiment time is selected to see possible signature of high-energy electron precipitation 
during early morning hours in case of possible activity.
