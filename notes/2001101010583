notes
Not on Hermann's list, but again geometrically similar to the above is 
an interval from 16-20 on the 12th.  The mainland radars are tied up 
with Special Programmes, but I noted that the ESR wasn't running. The 
CLUSTER footprint is actually poleward of Svalbard during this interval, 
so maybe a Northward-looking geometry is best (?)
