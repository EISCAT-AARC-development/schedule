notes
This experiment is intended to look for Brillouin effects arising from the 
interaction of an HF pump and probe wave, both generated by the EISCAT 
Heater. 
It has several common features with the RAMAN experiment, run in February 
2012 
(and uses the same UK time allocation).  The aim is to look for enhancements 
in 
the low-power probe wave (whose frequency is separated from that of the 
high-
power pump wave by the ion-acoustic frequency) and also to look for 
enhancements 
in the ion-acoustic line of the incoherent scatter spectrum (though at a 
very 
different wave number).

The experiment is scheduled as an alternative to DIME (also heater + one 
radar) 
and will only run if conditions are not right for DIME, or once the DIME 
allocation has been exhausted.
