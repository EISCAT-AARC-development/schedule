notes
This experiment aims at examining variations of the temperature between 80
and 110 km due to aurora effect (from above) and atmospheric wave effect (from
below). Clear sky and aurora activity are desired.
UHF mode will be  CP-2 mode-like, but scan pattern will be different from
standard ones. VHF mode will be vertical mode (CP6-like).
Collaborations of Japan and Norway. We might cancel at least one night because of short of resources.
