notes
This campaign will use simultaneous HEATER O-mode and X-mode pumping to check for damping effects on the following phenomena: (1) growth of striations (diagnostic: CUTLASS), (2) electron temperature enhancements (diagnostic: UHF), (3) growth of Langmuir turbulence (diagnostic: VHF), (4) by proxy, the (non-) appearance of artificial optical emissions.
