notes
The purpose of this study is to investigate the relationship between the        
measured ionospheric plasma parameters and the direction of the Heater beam        
with respect to the terrestrial magnetic field. To do this, the Heater beam will       
be held in a particular direction and the UHF Radar be scanned through the heated region to measure the plasma parameters at different positions. The        
CUTLASS Radar will be used to measure the backscatter power. This procedure will then be repeated for several Heater pointing directions and powers. One       
should note that the reference to "cp1l" in the experiment name is to the pulse       
code rather than to the pointing direction. It is possible that pulse code        
actually employed may be tau2 or tau3 rather than cp1l.
