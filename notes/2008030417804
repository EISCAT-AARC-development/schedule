notes
FAIs artificially induced by ionospheric heater are ideal Targets 
for studying creation and decay processes of FAIs. Though some or 
many of such studies including those with heater, IS UHF radars 
together with SuperDARN radars, this time we'll use SuperDARN TMS 
mode possibly with multi-frequency FDI technique together with 
Tromso UHF radar which latitudinally sweeping over the heater 
induced regions. This technique will, we hope, provide important 
information to reveal the essential physical creation/decay 
processes of FAIs.

Beata pulse code and sweep*_pattern.elan (in /kst/exp/ni/beata/scans) 
will be used for the Tromsoe and Kiruna UHF radar observations.
