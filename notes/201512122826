notes
Experiment requires high time resolution with coverage of E-region and electron
density peak (necessary for inversion to precipitating electron energy spectra)
with Ti and Te measurements at ~100-350 km. Both 32m and 42m dishes expected to
be used probably with the arc_slice experiment. This is in collaboration with
Sweden and Norway who will be requesting separate time for runs in the morning
hours.


Scientific Objectives are:
To investigate the response of neutral temperature in the thermosphere and
mesopause to different auroral energy inputs and processes; Tto investigate
whether neutral temperature height profiles vary between the polar cap and
auroral oval; to validate a new technique for inferring F-region neutral
temperature from spectrographic measurements of O+ aurora.
Field-aligned only â€“ no scanning
