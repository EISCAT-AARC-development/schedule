notes
This experiment is an investigation into the role of Alfven waves in the            
coupling between the auroral zone and the magnetotail. EISCAT observations will           
be made in conjunction with optical and satellite measurements. (The latter are           
variously Geotail, Polar, and Cluster.) The experiment will employ CP1 on the            
Mainland UHF Radar, and CP4 on the Mainland VHF Radar. Both Svalbard antennas            
will be used, with the Steerable Antenna pointing northwards on 10/11 January observing run and southwards on all other days.
