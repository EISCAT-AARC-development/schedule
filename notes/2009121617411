TEQUILAsunrise (Transient Effects Quantification Under Ionospheric Low Angle sunrise). The idea is to 
look at the polar wintertime mesophere through the transient
caused by (scattered) sunrise around 8 UT.  Interestingly, this happens to
be the maximum occurence time of the Polar Mesosphere Winter Echoes (PMWE).
