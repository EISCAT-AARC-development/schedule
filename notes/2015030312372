notes
Plasma line and plasma line enhancements will be studied with the new LT2 long pulse experiments. LT2 
experiments resolve the plasma line spectrum with high frequency resolution in order to study wave-wave 
interactions in the auroral ionosphere.

The EISCAT aperture synthesis imaging (EASI) receivers will also record the experiment. Optical 
observations are conducted with the auroral structures and kinetics (ASK) instrument when possible.

During the requested radar times the RELEC and SWARM satellites will pass over ESR.
