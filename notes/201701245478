To determine structure of fast flow channels forming on the dayside cusp region
and their propagation across the polar cap toward the nightside auroral oval
To determine impact of fast flow channels on global plasma circulation
processes, including magnetic reconnection, flux transfer events, plasma sheet
flow bursts, and subauroral polarization streams
