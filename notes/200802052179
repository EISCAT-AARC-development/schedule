notes
The purpose of this experiment is to study the nightside aurora. Particular 
areas of interest are signatures of poleward expanding substorms and polar cap 
patches of high electron density that enter the nightside auroral oval. This 
experiment also provides training to students taking the AGF-304 radar course 
at UNIS. We plan to use both antennas, and depending on the geophysical 
conditions at the time, we will use different pulse codes (e.g. tau0 and taro) 
and a combination of fixed positions one day, and azimuth and elevation scans 
the next day. The purpose is to show the students different ways of operating 
the radar, and collect data that they can use for GUISDAP analysis, project 
work and thesis work. This experiment has been approved for a total of 30 
hours Norwegian special time during Jan-Feb 2008.
