notes
The purpose of this experiment is to provide training to students taking the
AGF-304 radar course at UNIS. We plan to use both antennas, and depending on the
geophysical conditions at the time, we will use different pulse codes (e.g.
beata, ipy, tau0 and taro) and a combination of fixed positions, azimuth and
elevation scans(dependent on the state of the 32m dish). The students will 
decide on the operating mode and pulse code used based on a proposal they have
submitted as part of their course. The data will be used for their project work.
