notes
We request 30-50 hrs of mainland EISCAT time to be scheduled
preferably around new-moon in February/March 2014 with the following
scientific objectives:

1, studies of F-region artificial aurora/Radio-Induced Optical
Emissions. With main focus on how volume emission rate varies in 3-D
from the different emissions, as a function of frequency and ERP. With
hopes to see descending HF-enhanced ion-lines as another direct
measure of ionisation and see how it varies with frequency and ERP.

These observations will be complemented with SEE-measurements to
determine what exact relation between the pump-wave frequency and the
ionospheric resonance frequencies the different responses occur.

 
2, studies of enhanced ion and plasma-lines in auroral E-layers, with
the ambition to determine how the aurora is affected by HF-pumping.
 
3, studies of generation of pulsating aurora. For this we should heat
the E region with working cycle of 10 s ON 20 OFF with amplitude
modulation at frequency of several kHz (whistler wave resonance
frequency).
