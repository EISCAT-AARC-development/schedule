notes
By April 2004, the plane of the Cluster orbit has moved away from the Sun-Earth 
line.  Nevertheless, dayside magnetospause crossings continue to occur with 
magnetic footprints in the vicinity of EISCAT/ESR, and there continues to be a 
potential for cusp crossings throughout this interval.  For April 2004, I am 
requesting five intervals of EISCAT operation as follows:

April 01   06-12 UT
April 06   03-09 UT
April 13   05-11 UT
April 20   06-12 UT
April 25   03-09 UT

all of which are outbound magnetopause crossings.  The run on April 20 will be 
a combined operation with Sondrestrom, which will run from 09-14 UT.

As with the March operations, the best mode is LowElNorth on the ESR 32m dish, 
interleaved (1:1) with field-aligned operations on the 42m dish and low-
elevation northward-looking modes from the mainland, using either tau8 on the 
VHF or (if not available) dual-klystron tau1u on the Tromso UHF.
