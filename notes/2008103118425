notes
Recent studies using SuperDARN radars have shown intriguing relationships 
between pulsating aurora and changes in E region auroral backscatter. On 
the one hand, regular pulsations are associated with periodic changes in 
echo Doppler shift. On the other, irregular pulsations are associated 
with a new population of low altitude (D region) backscatter echoes. 
We aim to investigate these two phenomena by comparing a specially 
designed radar sounding mode of the CUTLASS radars with simultaneous 
observations of the aurora by TV cameras and electron density measurement 
by EISCAT radar in Tromsoe.

Arc1 or beata pulse code and CP-1 mode will be used for the KST UHF radar 
observations. We prefer good weather condition for the optical observations.
