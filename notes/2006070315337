notes
This is a UK experiment, using the ESR and UHF simultaneously, to study the 
density structure of the high-latitude ionosphere and to compare it with 
observations made by the UK's high-latitude tomography chain.

A full description of this experiment, including information on how to find all 
of the relevant files is available at:

If anything is unclear, queries should be directed to Alan Wood at UCW, 
Aberystwyth, whose contact details are given above.
