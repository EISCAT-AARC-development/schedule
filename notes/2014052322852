This is a joint UK-Norwegian experiment to provide EISCAT observations in 
support of a  potential CLUSTER spacecraft crossing of the substorm current 
wedge. The potential crossing interval is from 19:50 to 21:20 on May 23rd 2014, 
but a four hour run is scheduled on the basis that this is the minimum time for 
an EISCAT radar operation.

Although we are requesting 4-hour slots the experiment only really needs about 2
hours. Thus if any other experimenters request overlapping time we could come to 
an agreement to reduce the time that may be charged.

The experiment configuration should be the same as used in the CCOC experiments 
of April and May 2013: 

The VHF will be operated pointing at low elevation to the north 
The UHF will be operated at low elevation pointing generally north-west to
provide wider cusp coverage and 2D velocity estimates in conjunction with the
VHF 
The ESR 32m dish will point at low elevation to the north, interleaved with 
observations on the 42m dish.

The UK will contribute two hours of accounting time to the observations on each 
radar, on the basis that this will be matched by a similar contribution from 
Norway.
