notes
The scientific goals are:

1. Detection of global ducting of HF radio waves along solar
terminator.
The idea is to use the heater emission in the capacity of probe signal
to be registered in Antarctica (Ukrainian Antarctic Station
"Academician Vernadsky").

2. An attempt to excite and detect artificial oscillations within the
"Earth-ionosphere" cavity. The pump wave is supposed to be modulated
by an ELF signal with the frequency corresponding to one of the modes
of Schumann resonances. The results are expected to be obtained from
simultaneous ELF measurements in Tromsø (Norway), UTR-2 radio
telescope observatory (Kharkiv, Ukraine), and Academician Vernadsky
station (Antarctica).

Participants are:
Vasyl Belyey, Cesar La Hoz, Michael Rietveld, and Brett Isham.
