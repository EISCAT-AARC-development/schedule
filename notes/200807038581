notes
This is a joint entry to cover heating operations for three experiments (to save
schedule complexity). All three experiments are from the same research group
(Lancaster University). Note that the REIMEI experiment is to provide
UHF/Heating coverage for Reimei satellite overpasses. This should be allowed to
interrupt the joint UK-NO-CN "TRAP" experiment as well.

MZE 09-12 UT in conjunction with UHF
XMOD 08-12 UT in conjunction with VHF
REIMEI - see UHF schedule for this experiment.
