notes
Experiment objectives: Determine the evolution of large-scale plasma structure 
and irregularity regions in polar cap patches as they convect along a chain of 
heavily instrumented ground stations across the polar cap.  Ground stations 
include Resolute Bay, Qaanaaq, Station Nord, and Svalbard.  Radars at 
Sondrestrom and Resolute Bay will also be operated for these experiments.  The 
EISCAT Svalbard radar is intended to provide F-region plasma density and line-
of-sight ion velocities along the Scandinavian end of the chain, coordinating 
with ground measurements in Svalbard and Station Nord, Greenland, especially 
to provide horizontal coverage over Station Nord and altitude coverage along 
the chain between Nord and Svalbard.
Time window requested:  Jan 15-25, 7-12 UT, 18-24 UT.  Same windows have been 
requested for the Sondrestrom and Resolute Bay radars.
Desired geophysical conditions:  Moderate to high geomagnetic activity, with 
the polar cap boundary equatorward of or overhead Svalbard.  Southward IMF.  
Clear skies at at least 2 of the 4 stations in the chain.  We do not plan to 
run the radar if conditions are poor, and will plan to provide go/no-go 
decisions as far in advance as required by the radar operators.
Specific scan modes desired:  Azimuth scan at 30° or lower elevation centered 
on azimuth 315°, sweeping from az 270° to 360°, followed by an elevation scan 
along az 315° from 30° el (or lowest possible) to 90° el (zenith).  Desired 
time ~5 min for azimuth scan, ~4 min for elevation scan.  With time for 
repositioning between scans this should give a cadence of ~10 min.  Desired 
spatial resolution 50 km or better if densities allow shorter pulses and 
integration times.  Full azimuth scans at higher rates may be desired during 
UT morning window if patch formation activity is occurring, to capture the 
patch formation transient events and plasma source regions.
Requested dates and times in tabular format:  (note that we do not plan to use 
all of these windows and do not plan to run during periods with poor 
conditions for the coordinated ground measurements).
