notes
The VHF radar will run the standard manda experiment for  pointing
positions  90 deg, 80 deg, 70 deg 
If echo is strong it is desirable to use remote Rx. 
This is unusual experiment. It WILL BE ONLY RUN if conditions are suitable 
for PMWE, e.g.
electron/proton precipitation to enhance the D-region and/or if PMWE has 
been
observed by nearby MST radars  Esrad and Maarsy.
