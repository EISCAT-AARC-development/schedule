notes
This EISCAT experiment covers Swarm A and C (values for C in brackets) passing 
over TRO at 09:12:18(09:12:12) UT, h=458.0 km, r=466.9(459.2) km, El=78.3(85.6) 
deg.

The VHF system should be pointed vertically, remote sites intersecting at 458 km 
height.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Three Swarm satellites, A, B, and C, perform high precision magnetic field
measurements using both vector and scalar magnetometers. The
instrumentation includes a thermal ion imager (TII) and Langmuir probe
(LP). Together the LP and TII form the electric field instruments
(EFIs). The PI is David Knudsen <knudsen@ucalgary.ca> from the University of 
Calgary. For LP contact Stephan Buchert <scb@irfu.se>. Using EFI data electron 
density and temperature, ion drift vector and temperature and the perpendicular 
electric field can be derived. In addition accelerometer instruments, onboard 
GPS receivers and ground-based laser ranging of Swarm support a very precise 
orbit determination.
