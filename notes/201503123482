notes
The objectives of the experiment are to look for turbulent radar echoes 
parallel to the Earth's magnetic field in the acceleration region at about 
3000-6000 km altitude, and simultaneously observe the ionospheric effects in 
the E- and F- regions along the same field line. Such simultaneous observations 
can shed light on several important and not yet resolved questions about 
magnetosphere-ionosphere coupling and auroral acceleration. The formation of 
arcs, ion outflow and mechanisms causing the turbulent Naturally Enhanced Ion 
Acoustic Lines (NEIALs) in the ionosphere will be studied.

This is an experiment done in collaboration with and proposed by:
