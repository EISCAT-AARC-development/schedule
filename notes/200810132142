notes
The study of non-linear processes within the framework of ionospheric
modifications at polar latitudes, which could provide a better understanding
some mechanisms of plasma turbulence generation. For experiments, SPEAR
(Space Plasma Exploration by Active Radar) will be used for ionosphere pumping
and DEMETER and DMSP satellites will be employed for in situ turbulence testing
at topside ionosphere altitudes of ~ 660 – 840 km.
To measure by means of onboard satellite instruments plasma density and
temperature variations in the topside ionosphere when satellites will pass
through the center part of the magnetic disturbed tube (not far than ~ 50 – 100
km from its axis). Variations of electric and magnetic fields as well as energy
of particles will be also registered, wherever possible.
SPEAR has to begin operating 15 – 25 min before a satellite will be in the
closest point of its orbit to the center of a HF disturbed magnetic tube and
continue to radiate with full power at O-mode for 20 – 30 min. The pump beam has
to be directed at the magnetic zenith to enhance turbulence generation due to
the magnetic zenith effect. 
It is expected that approx. 2 – 4 appropriate orbits will take place every
day.Times when satellites will be over SPEAR are of about of 11 and 18 UT for
DEMETER and 08 and 13 UT for DMSP.
