notes
We want to investigate anisotropic ion heating and naturally enhanced ion-acoustic  lines in the topside ionosphere in the cusp region. The VHF antenna is directed so that there is a common volume with the ESR 42m antenna. This is done by installing new phase cables. The installation and calibration of the cables using radio stars requires access to the VHF antenna for several days before the experiment. We plan to do this 1-12/8, 15-23/8.
