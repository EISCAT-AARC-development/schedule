notes
The purpose of this experiment is to study flow transients, electron density 
structures, and mechanisms producing HF radar irregularities in the F-region. 
If the sky is clear, we will do coordinated ESR observations with the new 
optical station KHO. If it is cloudy, we will do coordinated ESR and SuperDARN 
measurements. The ESR modes we use will depend on geophysical conditions at 
the time of the observations. If the F-region density and the signal to noise 
ratio allows, we will do fast scans in elevation and azimuth with the 32m 
dish. If the F-region density is low, we will stay fixed with 32m dish at low 
elevation. At a minimum, we will collect at least 10-15 minutes of data from 
the 42m dish every hour (to be compliant with the IPY run).
