notes
The experiment is for SuperDARN technique development of the thermospheric 
neutral density measurement by the CUTLASS radar. In parallel, optical 
observations such as imagers, FPI and spectrograph will occur during the second 
half of each experiment. Heater operations will stop when the ionosphere goes 
under-dense.
