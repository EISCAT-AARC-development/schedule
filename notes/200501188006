notes
By agreement with Jean Lilensten this interval will form part of the French 
experiment, but the ESR will be used in the standard Cluster mode during the 
period of the Cluster overpass.  Data from the 42m (field-aligned) and 32m 
(LowElNorth)dishes will be interleaved (one dump from each) using whichever 
modulation is adopted for the French experiment.
