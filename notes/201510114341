This EISCAT experiment covers Swarm A and C (values for C in brackets) passing 
over ESR at 10:57:53(46) UT, h=462.9 km, r=463.1(466.1) km

32 m antenna pointing Az=75.9 deg, El=86.8 deg, for Swarm A
======================================

SWARM B passes over ESR at 14:08:55 UT, h=519.7 km, r=548.3. The 32m antenna 
pointing 1400-1430 UT should be Az=266.7 deg and El=70.5 deg

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Three Swarm satellites, A, B, and C, perform high precision magnetic field
measurements using both vector and scalar magnetometers. The
instrumentation includes a thermal ion imager (TII) and Langmuir probe
(LP). Together the LP and TII form the electric field instruments
(EFIs). The PI is David Knudsen <knudsen@ucalgary.ca> from the University of 
Calgary. For LP contact Stephan Buchert <scb@irfu.se>. Using EFI data electron 
density and temperature, ion drift vector and temperature and the perpendicular 
electric field can be derived. In addition accelerometer instruments, onboard 
GPS receivers and ground-based laser ranging of Swarm support a very precise 
orbit determination.
