notes
The aim of this experiment is to track GNSS satellites with the EISCAT radar 
through active auroral regions. Active pre midnight conditions are needed, but 
the actual day is not important. The day may also be moved forward to November 
if needed. Azimuth and elevation for the satellite tracks will be provided by 
DLR, as discussed in Roma on the ESPAS Kick-Off meeting with Ingemar. This 
request was not yet discussed with the German fellows but will stand down if 
IAP needs all German time! DLR operates two high rate GNSS receivers at Tromso 
and was already able to show that discrete aurora causes disturbances bigger 
than 5 TECU. This must now be understood by utiliying ISR data.
