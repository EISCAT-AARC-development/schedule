notes
The ESR will run the long pulse slopes experiment using the 32m dish in support
of a SPEAR heating experiment.  We will either run field aligned or scanning
through the heater patch depending on conditions.

The experiment is in run in conjunction with a recently deployed equipment at
Barentsburg which will be observing any artificial aurora generated by SPEAR.
The CUTLASS radars will also be running in support of the campaign.

THE RUN IS SUBJECT TO CANCELLATION IF WE DO NOT GET THE REQUIRED TIME ON OUR
HEAT ACCOUNT WHICH WE BID FOR IN THE LAST ROUND.
