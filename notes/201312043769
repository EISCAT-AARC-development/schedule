notes
This experiment will study polar cap flow and polar cap patches along the 
dayside auroral oval. The 32m beam will be pointed in various directions 
depending on activity, using a combination of azimuth scans and fixed 
positions. The experiment will also use data from GNSS scintillation and TEC 
receivers that have been recently installed at Bjørnøya, Hopen, Ny-Ålesund and 
Longyearbyen.
