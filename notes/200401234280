notes
I am submitting only two requests for Cluster operation in January 2004.  Both 
are magnetopause crossings, though the timing is not yet optimal for studies of 
the cusp (i.e. local time is still later than nominal for a cusp crossing) - 
the geometry will improve steadily during February and March.

The best geometry is probably the combination of VHF and ESR northward-looking 
modes, with ESR 32m observations being alternated (dump for dump) with field-
aligned observations from the 42m dish.

The proposed runs are  January 16   1000-1400
                  and  January 23   1000-1400

I suggest we try using the steffe mode for these runs at the ESR, so that we 
can compare the results with the tau0 data which has been taken up to now.
