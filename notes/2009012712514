notes
The objectives of the experiment are to look for turbulent radar echoes 
parallel to the Earth’s magnetic field in the acceleration region at about 2000-
3000 km altitude, and simultaneously observe the ionospheric effects in the E- 
and F- regions along the same field line. Such simultaneous observations can 
shed light on several important and not yet resolved questions about 
ionospheric coupling processes. The formation of arcs, ion outflow and 
mechanisms causing the turbulent Naturally Enhanced Ion Acoustic Lines (NEIALs) 
in the ionosphere will be studied.
