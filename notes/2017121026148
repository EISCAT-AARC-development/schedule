This campaign is aimed at acquiring EISCAT plasma line data so that the plasma
density measurements made by NorSat-1 during its conjunction with the ESR radar
can be compared.
In order to obtain plasma line data (from the 32m and ideally also 42 m dish)
the experiment 'beata' must be run.
During times when NorSat is not conjunct with the ESR cusp dynamics will be studied.
