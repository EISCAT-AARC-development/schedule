notes
(Note: This is a joint entry for Japanese VHF experiments.)

Recent studies using SuperDARN radars have shown intriguing 
relationships between pulsating aurora and changes in E region 
auroral backscatter. On the one hand, regular pulsations are 
associated with periodic changes in echo Doppler shift. 
On the other, irregular pulsations are associated with a new 
population of low altitude (D-region) backscatter echoes. 
We aim to investigate these two phenomena with simultaneous 
observations of the aurora by several cameras, and electron 
density measurement by EISCAT radar in Tromso.

Mandas code will be used for the Tromso VHF radar observation. 
We prefer good weather condition for the simultaneous optical 
observations.
