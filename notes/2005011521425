notes
This experiment is aimed to conduct coordinated observation on aurora and 
dynamics of the cusp and ‘bright spots’ with ground based EISCAT Svalbard 
radar detections and multi-wavelength monochromatic all-sky CCD imaging 
measurements at Ny Alesund and conjunction with DSP polar satellite. The 
interested time window is from 1000 to 1600 in MLT (or 0700-1300 in UT)15-17 
January 2005. The ESR steerable antenna will be operated in meridian scanning 
mode. The fixed and steerable antennas will be switched between every 3.2 sec. 
The monochromatic all-sky CCD imaging system at Ny Alesund will continuously 
measure 2-D intensity distributions of targeted auroras on 427.8nm, 557.7nm 
and 630.0nm at a sampling rate of a frame every 6 seconds.
