notes
This experiment aims to detect low-energy accelerated electrons created during
HF heating by means of the particle detector on the Reimei satellite.

Four overpasses occur during the campaign period. The UHF and heating operations
for this experiment should be allowed to interrupt the UK XMOD and MZE
experiments and the UK-NO-CN TRAP experiment. The heater operations for REIMEI
are scheduled under the 'LANCS_HEAT' joint entry with XMOD and MZE.

The UHF is only required for 30 minutes for each run. The run on 10 July will of
course only take place if an interruption of the CP run is allowed.
