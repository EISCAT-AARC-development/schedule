notes
The first UK interplanetary scintillation campaign of 2004 will use the three 
mainland sites, with the remote sites using a mixture of 930 MHz and 1.4 GHz 
observations.  The ESR will also be used for the first time to carry out 
scintillation measurements at 500 MHz during the second part of the campaign 
(starting May 7th).  Many of the EISCAT observations are simultaneous with 
measurements on the UK's MERLIN network. The time allocation for this campaign 
is 24 hours mainland + 6 hours Svalbard, so some of the mainland observations 
will have to be trimmed.  The detailed schedule can be found at
