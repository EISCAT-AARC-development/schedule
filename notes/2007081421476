notes
The ESR will run an experiment that depends on ionospheric conditions and
experimental objectives (probably the slopes long pulse experiment) using the
32m dish in support of SPEAR operations. The particular scan mode depends on
conditions.

The experiment will be run in conjunction with equipment at Barentsburg, which
will be observing a variety of SPEAR-induced effects. The CUTLASS radars will
also be running in support of the campaign.
