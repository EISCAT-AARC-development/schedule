notes
Ground support of the ICI-1 sounding rocket: Investigation of Cusp 
Irregularities will investigate the formation of HF radar backscatter 
irregularities in the cusp. Detailed diagnostics of launch condition will 
be provided by the CUTLASS, ESR, and the all-sky imagers located at 
Ny-Ålesund and Longyearbyen. The ideal conditions will be having the 
equatorward boundary of the optical cusp and the equatorward edge of radar 
cusp located near the apogee between Ny-Ålesund and Longyearbyen. We will 
point the ESR-1 beam towards the apogee position to measure the electron 
density profile, to ensure that we have a significant cusp ionosphere with 
electron densities peaking around 250 km. We know that the cusp electron 
density may sometimes peak at ~350 km, which will be too high for ICI-1. 
ESR observations of the particle impact ionization is thus of critical 
importance for determent of the ideal launch conditions.
