notes
On 20 March 2015 there will be a Total Solar eclipse in Svalbard. For 
Longyearbyen the totality will last from 10:10:42 - 10:13:09 UT (2min 27s). 
However, the partial eclipse will begin one hour before, and end one hour 
later. We therefore propose to run the ESR two hours before and after the 
eclipse, for a total of 4 hours. More information about the solar eclipse can 
be found here:
