notes
I would like to apply for EISCAT observation time this summer.    
We want to study PMSE with the VHF (the new CP-6) and the    
UHF (to measure electric fields over Andenes and electron densities).    
There will be a rocket campaign from Andenes 29.06. to 14.07. this year.    
Launches will be near local midnight. We will also measure NLC with    
ALOMAR, and use the ALWIN radar. We would like to run EISCAT for    
6 hours each night, centered on local midnight. We would need approximately    
100 hours SP time for this.
