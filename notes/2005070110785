notes
This experiment is intended as an investigation of ion temperature anisotropies 
in the topside ionosphere, using the Tromso UHF and ESR radars.
There are two possible observing configurations.  The ESR fixed dish is used to 
look field-aligned, and the mainland UHF is used to look into the ESR beam.  
The ESR steerable dish is pointed toward the south, at fixed elevation, so that 
its beam is also intersected by the Tromso UHF beam, at a lower altitude than 
the interasection with the beam from the ESR fixed dish.
A complete description of the experiment, and its scientific aims, can be found 
at www.eiscat.rl.ac.uk/~ian/experiments/beta.html
