notes
The purpose of this experiment is to provide training to students taking the
AGF-304 radar course at UNIS. We plan to use both antennas, and depending on the
geophysical conditions at the time, we will use different pulse codes
(e.g.beata, folke, and taro) and a combination of fixed positions, azimuth and
elevation scans.  The students will decide on the operating mode and pulse code
used based on a proposal they have submitted as part of their course. The data
will be used for their course project work. We will have optical support from
KHO and additional radar support from the new Longyearbyen SuperDARN radar.
We have overbooked by 4 hours.  It is expected we will use all hours on the 20th
- 23rd and only 4 of the 8 hours on the 19th.  We will inform EISCAT personnel
before the campaign begins.
