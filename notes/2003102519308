notes
I am requesting five EISCAT/Cluster runs in October.  The plane of the Cluster 
orbit is still close to the Sun-Earth line, with apogee in the nightside, 
making this interval useful for study of midnight sector processes such as 
substorms.  Four of the five requested intervals are close to Cluster crossings 
of the tail neutral sheet when the Cluster footprint is in the longituide 
sector of EISCAT and Sondy.  The remaining interval (October 15) is a cusp 
perigee pass.

The priority order is as follows (highest priority first)

06/10  16-22  UT
25/10  17-23  UT
15/10  04-10  UT
13/10  16-22  UT
02/10  17-23  UT

For each run, I am requesting ESR + VHF.  My preferred ESR mode is LowElSouth 
on the 32m dish, interleaved (1:1) with field-aligned dumps from the 42m dish.  
VHF should be in tau1 mode along the boresight.

The runs on the 2nd, 6th, 13th and 25th are suitable for co-ordination with 
Sondy and I will try to arrange such a co-ordination for at least soem of these 
runs.
