notes
The EISCAT Svalbard Radar 32m dish and the Svalbard SuperDARN radar scans will be 
synchronized within a common scattering volume. 
With this we will study the structure and evolution of ionospheric Flow Channels 
(FC), which are small-scale (~100km wide) velocity enhancements of >1km/s within 
the background convection flow.

It is important that this experiment is carried out at the requested time as this 
coincides with the SuperDARN discretionary time, which allows us to operate the 
Longyearbyen radar in our specialized scanning mode. We also require times when 
the moon is down or very dim so that we can record optics at the time of the 
experiment. This period and my other request (ESR: ESR_SD_FC 2017 11 20 0700 - 
2017 11 21 0900) are the only suitable times in November.

*NOTE* We have 40 confirmed SW hours but are awaiting confirmation for another 10 
and should receive before November.
