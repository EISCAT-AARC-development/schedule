notes
A multi-national campaign involving GE(80) and NO(24) and perhaps FR(?).
Russian collaborators from PGI will bring a receiver to do interferometry 
and determine the direction of arrival of SEE components at the ARIES (UK)
site.
UHF and VHF Langmuir turbulence measurements will be made simultaneously.
Perhaps CUTLASS also.
