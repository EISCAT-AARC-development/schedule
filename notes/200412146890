notes
A multi-instrument campaign involving EISCAT, CUTLASS (special mode), and 
STARE. The requested time is overscheduled and cancellation will occur 
depending on geophysical conditions (moderate to disturbed). The AAEV campaign 
is coordinated with the CRASE experiment so that if one is cancelled then 
another one will be run or vice versa. Altogether (AAEV+CRASE) 46 hours are 
requested while only 34 will be used.
