notes
Interstellar meteors have been reported from dust detectors onboard 
interplanetary missions such as Ulysses, Galileo and Cassini (Grün et al., 
1997; Ishimoto et al., 1999) as well as from the very sensitive radar 
facilities such as Arecibo Observatory (AO) radar in Puerto Rico (Meisel et 
al., 2002a, 2002b) and AMOR radar on New Zealand (Taylor et al., 1996). There 
are observations at other facilities (EISCAT, CMOR, ) that are close to solar 
system limits, but cannot be confirmed as unambiguously interstellars (Szasz 
et 
al., 2008, Brown et al., 2008; 2010). The understanding of the parameters 
affecting the way of the interstellars towards Earth's atmosphere has 
improved  
(Meisel, private communication) and the methods and observing routines for 
meteors have developed to deduce masses, densities, fragmentation etc (Kero et 
al., 2008). We propose coordinated observations with the AO radar, Middle and 
Upper atmosphere (MU) radar at Shikaragi, Japan and with the EISCAT VHF radar 
to search for interstellars during a measurement campaign.
