Using MANDA program, raw data recording, UHF & VHF TX vertical, and running simultaneously:

1. HF heating (HEA)
2. VHF Tromsø (VHF)
3. UHF Tromsø (TRO)
4. Kiruna VHF receiver (KIR)
5. Sodankylä VHF receiver (SOD)

Dates: 2016, July 12-15th & July 18th  (DoY 194-197, 200)

PMSE occurrence is mainly required, therefore there may be some cancellations, stand-by, and time-shifts 
(inside working hours and, of course, only if there are no other experiments scheduled to be executed).
