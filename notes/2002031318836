notes
A high resolution spectrograph HiTIES was set up last November at Ramfjordmoen for proton and electron aurora measurements. It will be running over the whole winter.  
This combined experiment between the optical instruments and the EISCAT radar is in collaboration with Unni Pia Lovhaug, Tromso University.
