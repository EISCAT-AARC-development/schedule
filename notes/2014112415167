notes
Studies of artificial aurora/radio-induced optical emissions from the F-layer
with main focus on how the three-dimensional volume emission rates varies with
frequency and ERP of Heating. The expectations is to be able to detect
time-variation of descending HF-enhanced ion-line and plasma-line spectra as
evidence of HF-induced Heating, and make observations of its variation with ERP
and frequency. Previous experiment in February 2014 was performed with
significantly reduced ERP, so since the ionospheric response to Heating is
strongly non-linear the experiment needs to be done with the maximum ERP
achievable with Heating.
