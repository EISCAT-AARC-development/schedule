notes
The idea is to measure the same plasma simultaneously with both UHF and VHF radars, and feed the 
ACFs from both radars to same plasma parameter fit process. Because the effect of ion-neutral 
collisions to IS spectrum depends on carrier frequency, the technique is expected to provide 
improvements to collision frequency measurements especially in E-region, because it reduces the 
correlation between collision frequency and temperature ratio. According to simulation studies, 
simultaneous fit of these two parameters should become possible.  EISCAT heating facility will be used 
for controlling the temperature ratio during the experiment.
