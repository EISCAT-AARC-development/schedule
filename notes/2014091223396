========================

Three Swarm satellites, A, B, and C, were launched on November 22,
2013, into polar orbits. They perform high precision magnetic field
measurements using both vector and scalar magnetometers. The
instrumentation includes a thermal ion imager (TII) and Langmuir probe
(LP). Together the LP and TII form the electric field instruments
(EFIs). The PI is David Knudsen from the University of Calgary. Using
EFI data electron density and temperature, ion drift vector and
temperature and the perpendicular electric field are derived. In
addition accelerometer instruments, onboard GPS receivers and
ground-based laser ranging of Swarm will support a very precise orbit
determination.
