notes
REXUS is a rocket program for university students sponsored by SNSB and DLR. In
2015 the so called SCRAP experiment will be flown within this program. SCRAP
stands for 'scattering of radar waves on aerosols in plasma' and is built by
students at KTH. The objective of the experiment is to test theories on dusty
plasmas by measuring the UHF radar backscatter on a controlled cloud of aerosol
particles.
The campaign in March 2014 will be held in preparation for the REXUS launch
campaing in spring 2015. We aim at measuring typical electron densities near the
expected rocket apogee, approximately 80-85 km above ESRANGE, and to test
suitable radar programs. Results will be used for modelling of the aerosol
charging time and specific design requirements for the SCRAP experiment.

Manda vs. 4 will be used.
