notes
EISCAT experiment in conjunction with a SPEAR heating campaign.
Additional time on the SuperDARN radars will be run in conjunction with the
experiment.

The experiment and exact scan will be decided on the day but it will be one of
the SPEAR scan modes and probably the SLOPES code.

The time is heavily overbooked in anticipation of the 10 day CP2 run starting
during the campaign. If this happens then most of the runs during this period
will be cancelled.
The experiments are also subject to ionospheric conditions.
