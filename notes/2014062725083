notes
Using MANDA program (MORRO radar-compatible experiment) and running simultaneously:
1. HF heating/radar (HEA)
2. VHF Tromsø (VHF)
3. UHF Tromsø (TRO)
4. Kiruna VHF receiver (KIR)
5. Sodankylä VHF receiver (SOD)

Dates: June 26 - July 11th (Week days), 09-13UT.

We will try to dosify our resources along the campaign accordingly to the mesospheric conditions and 
heating response of the PMSE. PMSE will be monitored by the MORRO radar at least from the beginning 
of the campaign each day.
