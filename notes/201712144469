notes
The EISCAT Svalbard Radar 32m dish and the Svalbard SuperDARN radar scans will be 
synchronized within a common scattering volume. 
With this we will study the structure and evolution of ionospheric Flow Channels 
(FC), which are small-scale (~100km wide) velocity enhancements of >1km/s within 
the background convection flow.

It is important that this experiment is carried out at the requested time as this 
coincides with the requested SuperDARN discretionary time, which allows us to 
operate the Longyearbyen radar in our specialized scanning mode. We also require 
times when the moon is down or very dim so that we can record optics at the time 
of the experiment. This is the only available period in December.

*NOTE* We have 40 confirmed SW hours but are awaiting confirmation for another 10 
and should receive before November. 
***Also, I have requested SuperDARN discretionary time for this period but will 
not hear the final decision from them on whether I get the time until the first 
week of November.
