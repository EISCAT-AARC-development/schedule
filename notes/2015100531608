notes
These measurements are connected to a rocket launch at Esrange, Sweden. While 
this request covers the time period August 1-5, we will only need 
approximatetly half of these days, depending of the exact timing of the rocket 
launch. Cancellation of dates that are not needed will be made at latest on the 
previous working day. 

Measurement hours connected to a second rocket launch during the approximate 
period October 10-20  will be requested separately (experiment name OSTATES 2).

A scientific motivation for these EISCAT measurements has been sent to Stephan 
Buchert as Swedish representative.
