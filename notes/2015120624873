notes
The plasma blobs are formed when the polar cap patches enter into the nightside 
auroral region. The 
studies of blobs are limited due to the unavailability of monitoring methods. It 
was recently found that 
the blobs are associated with strong irregularities (even stronger than the 
polar cap patches). The 
blobs are formed in a very dynamic region where the high density F region plasma 
could interact with the 
particle precipitation and flow shears around auroral arcs. This is the main 
motivation of the Norwegian 
ICI-4 rocket which was launched in February, 2015. 

In this experiment, we will make coordinated measurements by using both UHF and 
ESR. Both radars will 
run a fast meridional scan from 30 degrees north to 30 degrees south. The 
coordinated measurements will 
make a bigger field-of-view and increase the time resolution in the region 
between Svalbard and Tromsø. 
This region is important because it is where patches were frequently observed to 
enter into the auroral 
region. The UiO all sky camera measurements from Ny-Ålesund, Longyearbyen, and 
Ski-botn will also be 
used to assist this experiment. The requested time is 18:00-23:00 UT. Good 
weather condition is 
preferred.
