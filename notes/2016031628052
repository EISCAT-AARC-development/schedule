notes
This is a request for EISCAT mainland (VHF) time to support observations by the 
University of Oulu KAIRA facility. The VHF experiment will probably be a
standard D-region mode with vertical pointing, in order to compare energetic
particle measurements at Tromso with those inferred from the  riometric
measurements made by KAIRA.  Two 6 hour runs are being requested.
