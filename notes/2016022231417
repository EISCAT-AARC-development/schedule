notes
The VHF radar will run the standard "manda" program for different pointing
positions such as 90deg, 80deg, 70deg 
If echo is strong it is desirable to use remote Rx. 
The experiment WILL BE ONLY RUN if conditions are suitable for PMWE, e.g.
electron/proton precipitation to enhance the D-region and/or if PMWE has been
observed by other radars like Esrad and Maarsy.
