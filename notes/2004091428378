notes
September is the most important month of the tail conjunction, when the Cluster 
orbit will be aligned with the Sun-Earth axis, and a number of good 
conjunctions occur in the midnight sector.  Following the launch of Double Star 
(Polar) in July, this will probably also be the only tail campaign in which 
Cluster and Double Star are active together.

For September 2004, I have selected six intervals as follows:

02/09/04  19-01     ESR,VHF
14/09/04  19-23     ESR (VHF running CP)
19/09/04  1730-2330 ESR, VHF
21/09/04  1730-2330 ESR, VHF
26/09/04  1700-2100 ESR
          1700-2300 VHF
28/09/04  0600-1200 ESR, VHF

In priority order for Cluster the 14th is the most important conjunction, 
followed by the 2nd, 21st, 28th (perigee pass), 26th and 19th.

Double Star (Equator) is in a good position for the runs on the 2nd, 19th and 
26th.  I do not have the orbit predictions for Double Star (Polar) to hand as 
yet.
