notes
Farley-Buneman turbulence and anomalous heating in the E region will be studied
in this epxeriment. An elevation scan pattern will be run on the UHF radar to
probe the E region above Esrange rocket range. ALIS camera network will have
common volume configured in the same locus to monitor the aurora. Special
programme operation on SuperDARN Finland radar is requested with higher range
and time resolution in the common volume.

The experiment is run in preparation for the SPIDER rocket launched from Esrange
in 2015.
