notes
Exploiting the capability of the newly upgraded EISCAT Heating facility, we'll design and use a new set of 
heating experiments dedicated to produce Artificial Periodic Irregularities (API) in the negative ion 
dominated D-region ionosphere. The traditional API method is improved by sophisticated radar 
techniques, such as measuring the Faraday rotation. The VHF radar is necessary for monitoring the 
ionospheric conditions. These measurements are carried out in collaboration with simultaneous ECOMA 
experiments.
