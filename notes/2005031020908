notes
I am requesting a simple field-aligned tau2 experiment to cover three passes 
of DMSP F-16 in the interval 16-20 UT on March 9,10 and 11.  This will be the 
last chance to cover auroral passes this winter before daylight interferes.  
The aim is to calibrate and evaluate the DMSP auroral imager against EISCAT 
data showing precipitation characteristics and boundaries.
