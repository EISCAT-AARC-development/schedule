notes
The HF facility will radiate vertically to modulate the D-region electron 
temperature while the VHF and UHF radars observe any modulation of PMWE. The 
radars will point vertically and run the standard "manda" program.

The experiment will only run if conditions are suitable for PMWE, e.g. electron 
precipitation to enhance the D-region and/or if PMWE has been observed in other 
radars such as MORRO. It is also possible that some facilities (e.g. UHF or VHF 
remotes) will not be used in each case.
