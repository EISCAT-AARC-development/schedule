notes
 In the period June 30th until July 14th 2008, the international ECOMA
(=Existence and charge state of meteor smoke particles in the middle atmosphere)
rocket campaign will take place at the Andoya Rocket Range. Three sounding
rocket payloads will be launched to characterize particle and plasma parameters
as well as the neutral atmosphere under conditions of polar mesosphere summer
echoes (PMSE) and noctilucent clouds. Complementary to these rocket
observations, we plan for PMSE-observations with the EISCAT VHF and UHF-radars,
in part to study the frequency dependence of PMSE, but primarily to seek for
particle signatures in the incoherent scatter signal.
