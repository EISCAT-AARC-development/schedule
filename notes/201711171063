notes
This is a continuation of the Nansen campaign investigaing ion outflow in the
auroral zone and polar cap.  Part of the campaign will also form part of the
fieldwork for AGF345/845 - Polar Magnetospheric Substorms.
Nansen-IV: ESR studies of ion outflow from the polar cap. 
16-17 Nov in combination with field work AGF345 / auroral studies.
22 Nov - cusp studies
27th and 28th Nov - polar cap studies

Time has been overbooked with the aim of cancelling either the 16th and 17th
November nearer the time based on space weather conditions.
