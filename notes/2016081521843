notes
In order to study the connection between PMSE and NLC we intend to
simultaneously observe PMSE and NLC at about the same volume in space using two
optical cameras at Kiruna and Nikkaluokta and the EISCAT VHF in Tromsö. Optical
NLC observation conditions from Kiruna are better later in the summer. The NLC
cameras will be automatically run each night from the beginning until the end of
August.

Requested observation:
VHF tri-static observations during 6 hours around midnight (between 20:00 and
02:00 UT) ideally during 2 nights per week, beginning from 8th August until 26th
August, totally 54 hours for the VHF tri-static measurements (Tromsö, Kiruna and
Sodankylä, i.e., 6 nights x 6 hrs x 1.5).

A scientific motivation for these EISCAT measurements has been approved by
Stephan Buchert as Swedish representative.
