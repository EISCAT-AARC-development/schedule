notes
We run the VHF radar and ESR with CP4 mode together with optical 
instruments. The target is to investigate PMAF(oleward Moving Aurora Form)-like phenomena.
Also, we will have conjunction observations with REIMEI satellite at four times during the period.
Satonori Nozawa will take care of the VHF radar observations, while Yasunobu Ogawa will take care of
ESR observations.
