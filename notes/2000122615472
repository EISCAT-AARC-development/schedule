notes
Dec 26th.  This is somewhat similar to the 7th, except that the
magnetic footprint of CLUSTER is a bit further west.  This means that
CLUSTER moves northward between ESR and Sondy between 02 and 04 (closest
approach to ESR about 0340). From 04 until 12, it's probably in the polar
cap, then moves back over Svalbard (very close about 1240) and then by
1400 it's over Greenland, where the satellites exit across the
magnetopause.

For this day, it might well be worth looking towards Sondy both at the
beginning and end of the interval, (say 02-05 and 12-18) and northward
at low elevation from 05 to 12, interleaving with field-aligned
obseravtions once again.
