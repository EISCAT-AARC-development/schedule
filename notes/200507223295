notes
 
the proposed antenna position of the 32-m radar.
It consists of three antenna positions;
Az: --- El: 90 (geographic vertical)
Az: 1 El: 75 (north beam)
Az: 91 El: 75 (east beam)


The integration period is 64 seconds( do you think that 64s is enough for ESR?)at each antenna position. While the 32m antenna moves to the next position ( about 1minute), observatoins with the 42m radar are available to obtain the field-aligned data.
