notes
The purpose of this experiment is to provide training to students taking the
AGF-304 radar course at UNIS.
We plan to use both antennas, and depending on the geophysical conditions at the
time, we will use different pulse codes (e.g.beata, ipy, tau0 and taro) and a
combination of fixed positions, azimuth andelevation scans(dependent on the
state of the 32m dish). 
The students will decide on the operating mode and pulse code used based on a
proposal they havesubmitted as part of their course. The data will be used for
their project work.
