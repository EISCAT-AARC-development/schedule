notes
Participation in the NASA 2007 TRICE campaign from Andoya (PI: Craig Kletzing). 
The combination of ground and in-situ measurements will provide an excellent 
opportunity to explore spatial and temporal variations in magnetospheric- 
ionospheric coupling processes in the cusp ionosphere. Operations required: 
ESR - fixed dish, standard field aligned operations, Steerable dish - standard 
pulse scheme, pointing northward along the rocket trajectory. UHF (Norwegian 
time) and VHF (French time) will be combined, both at low elevation looking 
north over Svalbard for convection experiment.
