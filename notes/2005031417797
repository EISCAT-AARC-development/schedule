notes
Radar observations of naturally enhanced ion and plasma lines conducted near 
local midnight. Both VHF (20:00-02:00 UT) and UHF (21:00-01:00 UT) Tromsø 
radars will be used to monitor lower ionosphere (90-400 km). VHF radar will be 
operated (6 hours per night) in an interferometric mode recording data from 
two halves of the antenna directed to zenith. UHF radar will provide (4 hours 
per night) field-aligned observations. Optical data from field-aligned 
direction will be simultaneously recorded by Odin auroral imager.
