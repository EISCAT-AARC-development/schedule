Collaborative campaign for heater-induced airglow and plasma turbulence:              
GE:20, SW:20, UK:16, NI, ?                
Contacts: M. Rietveld, T. B. Leyser, F. Honary, T. Aso.                
Airglow will be measured using both ALIS and DASI (at Skibotn).                
CUTLASS HF radar is also requested, as well as dynasonde.              
              
Actually EISCAT UHF is the preferred radar,               
but due to unavailability we choose VHF.
