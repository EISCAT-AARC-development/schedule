notes
In order not to conflict with the MAC-WAVE campaign, or the French TEC studies, I am only requesting two observation periods for the mainland radars in support of Cluster for January, namely January 5th 09-14 UT and January 17th 08-12 UT, both co-inciding with requested ESR experiments.  As with the December bookings, I suggest low elevation tau3.  Using an azimuth of 354.9 degs and
an elevation of 30 degs would give a pointing which intersects the Svalbard
radar field-aligned beam at 610 km altitude.  This might be interesting, particularly if dual-klystron UHF operations were possible (although I guess this is unlikely).
