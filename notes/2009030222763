notes
The scientific objective is development of the pulse scheme
appropriate for the height-resolved ion-speed measurement
in the lower ionosphere. Coherent echo analysis is employed
for the development as well as general incoherent analysis.
To achieve it we are planning to install an independent
receiving system for the backscatter signal onto the present 
system.
