notes
This is an expriment to measure electron gyro harmonic effects in HF-enhanced airglow to be  
measured with ALIS.   
  
It is a joint experiment with UK, GE, FI, and NI using Heating, UHF, and VHF scheduled 4 March to 10 March  
at 1700-2200 UT.  
  
The Swedish input to these experiments is 20 hours.
