notes
This experiment is an investigation into the role of particle precipitation and  
the auroral emissions so produced. A particular goal is the identification of the  role of proton precipitation. The proposed experimental mode is tau0  
modulation on the Svalbard Fixed Antenna. Observations are to be made in  
conjunction with  the UK spectrometer located in Adventdalen. There will be simultaneous Mainland observations using Norwegian time.
