notes
This is the second experiment investigating ion-neutral coupling at an altitude 
in the region 250-300km using three FPIs and the three EISCAT radars to view 
the same volume. The dynamics of ion drag on the neutrals and energy 
dissipation will be studied using this unique geometric configuration which 
gives independent tristatic measurements of the ionosphere and thermosphere.
