notes
During July, the configuration of the Cluster orbit is such that the apogee 
moves away from the magnetospheric flanks and into the nightside.  Hence the 
orbit is entirely contained inside the magnetosphere for essentially the whole 
month.  This means that conjunctions between EISCAT and Cluster occur almost 
every day, but because apogee is in the lobe, these conjunctions are arguably 
not the most interesting scientifically.

Neutral sheet crossings begin on July 12th as the orbit moves into the 
nightside, , but most of the time the footpoints of these crossings are over 
Canada or Russia, so the geometry is not good for EISCAT.  We have selected the 
neutral sheet crossing on July 28th/29th, when the Cluster footprint is closest 
to EISCAT (though still nominally over the Russian Arctic).  

Provided the VHF still provides latitude coverage as far as Svalbard, we could 
continue to use the low-elevation northward looking beam of the VHF, in 
conjunction with a low elevation northward-looking mode (LowElNorth) on the 32m 
ESR dish, to provide coverage all the way from Tromso toward northern 
Greenland.  The ESR measurements on the 32m dish should be interleaved with 
field-aligned measurements on the 42m dish, but 1:1 interleaving is less 
important than in the cusp conjunction - maybe 2 dumps on the 32m for every 
dump on the 42m would be better.

If the VHF fails to get good signal at the range of the ESR, then another good 
option might be to point the ESR 32m dish south, towards Tromso, so that the 
(auroral) region between the two stations is covered.
