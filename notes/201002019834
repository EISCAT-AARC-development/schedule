notes
ESR measurements in conjunction with a SPEAR heating experiments. ESR runs are 
planned to be carried out from 1 to 4 February from 12 to 15 UT. ESR will run 
in the magnetic field-aligned direction in a beata code. Measurements can be 
cancelled due to unsuitable ionospheric conditions (critical frequencies in 
the F2 layer drop below 3.2 MHz.
