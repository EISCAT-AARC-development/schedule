notes
This is a joint entry for the following UK experiments (mostly from Lancaster 
University) which have similar requirements for heater and radar operations:

POND UK(6),NI(9) – neutral density estimation via artificial ion upwelling.
HAIL UK(13.5) – artificial ionisation layers.
EARTH UK(12) - ???
PRAISE UK(1) – artificial aurora.
PLEE UK(8) – heater-accelerated electron fluxes via plasma lines
RAMAN UK(24) – Raman amplification (PI: Bob Bingham, RAL)

Note that POND is in fact a UK-Japan experiment.

Except for RAMAN, the HF facility will be operated field-aligned, using O-mode. 
The UHF radar will also operate field-aligned, most probably using the beata 
code.

Most of the operations are likely to take place during normal site working hours 
and exact start and end times will be notified to the site staff as early as 
possible. The period of 14:15-16:00 UT (outside working hours) will only be used 
if weather conditions permit optical observations and the ionosphere is strong 
enough for heating, therefore cancellation of this interval should be expected.
