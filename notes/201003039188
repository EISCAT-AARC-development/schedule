notes
We will make an optical campaign using  FPI, aurora imager, aurora cameras, proton imagers
and 4-wavelength photometer with the EISCAT UHF radar (CP-1 & CP2, arc1 or beata,
tristatic measurements). The new LIDAR will start operation.
Clear sky and higher geomagnetic activity are desired.

So, we will run this SP for 3 nights out of 5 night requested.
