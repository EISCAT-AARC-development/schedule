notes
The purpose of this experiment is to provide training to students taking the
AGF-304 radar course at UNIS. We plan to use both antennas, and depending on the
geophysical conditions at the time, we will use different pulse codes (e.g.
beata, ipy, tau0 and taro) and a combination of fixed positions, azimuth and
elevation scans(dependent on the state of the 32m dish). The purpose is to show
the students different ways of operating the radar, and collect data that they
can use for GUISDAP analysis, project work and thesis work.
