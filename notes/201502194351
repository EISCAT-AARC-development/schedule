notes
The main objective of ICI-4,  to be launched from Andøya Space Centre, is to
explore F-region plasma instability processes in connection with auroral blobs.
The phenomenon is created when polar cap patches, islands of high electron
density plasma, exit the polar cap at night, i.e. when they entering the night
time auroral oval. The ingredients are high density F-region plasma structures,
imposed by auroral precipitation, field aligned currents and flow shears. This
appears to be the most violent situation for GPS scintillations. This region is
a highly complex region of the auroral ionosphere driven by tail reconnection.
In order to precisely diagnose the launch conditions we will combine information
from the ACE satellite, radars and all-sky imagers as well as ground
magnetometers. The campaign period allows 14 effective days from 9-22 February
2015. At the day when rocket is launched we will stop the radar operation as
soon as we have got the large scale context of the detailed in-situ
measurements. ESR will be operated in an azimuthal scan mode to survey transport
of polar cap patch material across the rocket trajectory. EISCAT UHF will be
pointed across the rocket trajectory.
