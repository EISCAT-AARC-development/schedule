notes
This is request for ESR operations in support of the UCL SCANDI interferometer, 
which should be operational in the new observatory at Breinosa by the time of 
the campaign. The aim is to run the experiment for six hours, three times 
within a week of new moon on December 9th, with one run taking place during the 
cusp interval (05-11 UT) and the other two runs taking place during the 
midnight sector (19-01 UT). 

The experiment is over-booked by a factor 3 because it requires relatively 
cloud-free conditions.

In principle, the SCANDI imager can tolerate the presence of some cloud.  
However, if conditions are not perfectly clear at the time of the run, the 
experimenters should check with Eoghan Griffin (+442076793433, 
eoghan@apl.ucl.ac.uk) to make sure that SCANI has sufficient signal to justify 
a run.

The experiment consists of a small scan, with three positions, one of which is 
field-aligned, the other two having elevations of 63.5 degrees north and 
south.  More complex scans may be used if justified by the conditions, but this 
would require good SNR at the ESR.
