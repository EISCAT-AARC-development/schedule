notes
This request covers a series of short (30 minute) observations for calibration 
and validation of the data from the new auroral imager on the DMSP-F17 
satellite. The program will be essentially the same as that used earlier for 
the calibration of the similar imager on DMSP F-16. During the closest approach 
of the satellite the radar will be fixed field-aligned, though a small scan may 
be used on either side of the closest approach, depending on ionospheric 
conditions.
