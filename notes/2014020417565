notes
When PMWE are relatively strong run manda exp with 3.6 s dump.
1) PMWE and heating: heating modulation as e.g. 18 s on/ 18 s off; 18 s on/72 s off.  – 1 day : 4 hours 
VHF radar + 4 h Heating
2) EISCAT VHF radar and NO heating during PMWE event: changing Tx : pointing vertically and tilted   – 1 
day: 4 hours of the EISCAT VHF 

3) We intend also to check an accuracy of the EISCAT measurements of electron density at 60-80 km 
during energetic particle precipitation conditions which are favorable for PMWE detection.
