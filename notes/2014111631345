notes
The main objective of the SCRAP rocket experiment is to validate theories on density fluctuations in 
dusty plasmas by measuring the scattering of ultra-high frequency radio waves on a cloud of electrically 
conductive microparticles spread in the mesospheric plasma. By using the EISCAT UHF radar to observe 
a cloud of calibrated mesospheric dust particles, the SCRAP experiment will relate theoretical 
predictions to a controlled object. The results will provide a new insight on phenomena such as polar 
mesospheric summer echoes, anomalous radar echoes which are thought to be caused by mesospheric 
clouds of ice particles.
The SCARP experiment will be performed in spring 2015. The success of the experiment relies on the 
possibility to detect the radar backscatter of the microparticle cloud and resolve the spectra of so called 
dust acoustic waves.
The experiment has been selected into the REXUS/BEXUS Programme under ESA, DLR, SNSB, SSC and 
ZARM and will be launched on one of their rockets during the spring of 2015.

During the November campaign we will observe the Leonids meteor shower which deposits meteor dust 
in the upper atmosphere. We are interested in the observation of the presence of dust, related to this 
event, in the Ionosphere.

The SCRAP experiment obtained 12 hours of use of EISCAT radar from the peer review application which 
will be used in this campaign.
