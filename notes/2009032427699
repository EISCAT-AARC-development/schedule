notes
It is intended that the ionospheric heater will be operated in conjunction 
with the UHF radar to study the following:
1. To investigate how the purely growing mode (PGM) feature in incoherent 
scatter spectra depends on the heater power transmitted, and the resulting 
error incurred in estimates of the electron temperature. The heater will be 
operated at power intervals of 2.5%,5%,10%,25%,50% and 100% full power, and 
the beam aligned with the magnetic field, with the UHF radar operating in CP1L 
mode aligned along the magnetic zenith. CUTLASS radars in Finland and Iceland 
will also be making backscatter measurements simultaneously
2. To test whether the electron temperature-dependence in current models of 
heater-induced field-aligned irregularity (FAI) growth and decay are 
compatible with experimental observations of artificial backscatter made by 
the CUTLASS coherent scatter radar facility. It is intended that the heater 
will be operated at full power and the heater beam aligned along the magnetic 
zenith to induce strongest heating effects. The EISCAT UHF will be making 
measurements at different scan positions available 
Some scheduled hours may not be used owing to poor ionospheric conditions if 
present
