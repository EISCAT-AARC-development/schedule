notes
Experiment for studying the Polar Mesosphere Winter Echoes (PMWE) under HF Heating using EISCAT 
VHF for supporting MORRO radar. The HF heating uses a special setup oriented to promote an increase 
of the PMWE strength right after the end of the heating pulse, i.e. the overshoot technique. We expect to 
measure this overshoot effect in the PMWE.

Running of the EISCAT facilities is subject to occurrence of PMWE in the MORRO radar.

The daily time range is 4 hours starting from 10:00 to 14:00 UT
