Oct 5 0900 Internal Cusp west of ESR east of STF         
This is a  
perigee pass, so I guess the cusp geometry referred to above might 
be the best one.  One suggestion I might make would be to move the 
VHF operations scheduled for the 3rd to this interval instead. 
This again is flagged by Hermann as a candidate for Sondy.
