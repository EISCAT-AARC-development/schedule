notes
The purpose of this campaign is to study particle precipitation by means of 
high resolution radar measurements made in collaboration with various high 
resolution optical observations, using the SIF, located at the Auroral Station 
in Adventdalen.  The experiment will employ the 42m antenna using the "arc" 
pulse code.  It is essential that we run during the "no-moon" period for our 
optical instruments.  The experiment will require clear skies and disturbed 
conditions.
