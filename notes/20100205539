notes
To measure the "electron line", that is the doppler  widened  backscatter from 
electrons, in varying solar EUV photo-ionization. To use the measured spectra 
to monitor the energetic photo-electron distribution. Attempt to directly 
measure the HF Heating accellerated electron spectra in the energy range 1-50 
eV. Quiet geomagnetic conditions are required. Cancellations are anticipated. 
The UHF will run a standard code, e.g. beata. The VHF will run a special 
program.
