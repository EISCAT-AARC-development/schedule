notes
This is a joint experiment between the University of Southampton (UK) and
KTH(SW) & the time should be split: UK(10)SW(25)

Main science objectives:
- To investigate the response of neutral temperature in the thermosphere and
mesopause to different auroral energy inputs and processes.
- To compare neutral temperature changes with radar measured ion and electron
temperatures in order to understand the heating of the upper atmosphere better.
- To validate a new technique for inferring F-region neutral temperature from
spectrographic measurements of O+ aurora.
- To understand the mechanisms that operate at the boundary of the polar cap and
auroral oval.
- To investigate the aurora that occurs within the polar cap, in order to
differentiate between possible acceleration mechanisms.

The radar will be run in a field-aligned position, and it is likely that the
arc_slice experiment will be used. Clear skies and aurora are strongly preferred.
