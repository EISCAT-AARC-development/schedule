notes
In order to investigate the dynamics and energetics in the polar lower thermosphere, coordinated 
sounding rocket observation with the European Incoherent Scatter (EISCAT) radar, ground-based Fabry-
Perot Interferometers (FPIs), and other instruments will be made. After the rocket is launched, we will 
cancel the remainder runs.  "CP-2" mode will be conducted.
