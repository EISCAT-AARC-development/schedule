notes
The objective with the HOTTIE (High-altitude O+ Temperature to
Thermosphe-Ionosphe-density Experiment) is to use electron-density and ion and
electron temperature measurements with the VHF and UHF radars combined
with Heating to estimate the neutral densities in the
thermoshpere. For the E-region this will be done by estimating the
collision electron frequency from the shapes of the ion-line-spectra
observed with the UHF and VHF radars, for the bottom-side F-region this
will be done by determining the electron cooling characteristics and
for the topside F-region this will be done by equilibrium between
ion-heating and ion cooling. The experiment requires quiet geomagnetic
conditions and will be cancelled if there is a geomagnetically active
day.
