notes
This experiment will study polar cap flow and polar cap patches near the 
nightside auroral oval. Data from both dishes will be used, and the 32m beam 
will look along the magnetic meridian towards the northern edge of the auroral 
oval. We will use a combination of azimuth scans and fixed positions, 
depending on geophysical activity. The experiment will also use data from GNSS 
scintillation and TEC receivers that have been recently installed at Bjørnøya, 
Hopen, Ny-Ålesund and Longyearbyen.
