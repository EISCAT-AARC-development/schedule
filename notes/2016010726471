notes
Reverse-flow events (RFEs) were first observed in incoherent scatter data and
have since been studied in detail. They are fast flows (~1 km/s) in the opposite
direction of the background convection flow, typically extending several 1000 km
in longitude but only about 100 km in latitude. Whereas their connection to
dayside reconnection is quite well studied, their connection to polar cap patch
formation and the location of the return flow of this feature is unknown. We
plan to study RFEs and their return flow by using two SuperDARN radars in a
specifically designed mode in conjuction with the ESR in windscreen-wiper mode
and auroral imager observations from Svalbard.
