notes
This request covers two different experiments (BLOB and TOI) both of which are 
elevation scans in support of tomographic measurements by the Aberystwyth 
network of beacon satellite receivers.  These experiments should run at least 
twice during the campaign for six hours (18-24).  The TOI experiment uses both 
mainland and ESR, BLOB uses mainland only.

For scheduling purposes, I am requesting six possible slots - however, this 
experiment should be second priority on each day behind the optical experiments 
(POLARLIS and TETRA) at ESR and Tromso.  The tomographic measurements do not 
need clear skies, so this gives the campaign teams a useful backup to run if 
the skies are not clear.
