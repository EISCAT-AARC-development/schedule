notes
measurements of electron density and ISR spectra 75 km - 120 km, UHF, using
Kiruna to receive from 86 km. (I don't know how to input into the form that we
wish to use Kiruna as well.) Beginning 28 October, measurements 11-12 UT and
19 - 03 UT. A rocket will be launched from ESRANGE with Faraday rotation for
N_e profiles and a special instrument to measure Hunten's smoke particles. In
addition, the Saura MF radar will measure N_e continuously.The launch window
opens on 28 October for 5 days, 19-03 UT each night. We have 25 hours total (15
GE and 10 NO), so we must cancel on some days, when there will be no countdown,
and/or after the launch.
