notes
This observations are in collaboration with Southampton University Group, UK.
The primary goal is to study the effects of electron and proton precipitation 
in the ionoshere, in terms of ionization, optical emissions and heating. 
University of Southampton operates the Spectrographic Imaging Facility at the 
auroral station. The additional requested time will extend the UK observations 
to late pre-noon local times, in order to investigate the role of resonant 
scattering of sunlight on N2+ ions in aurora (along with the original goals of 
the experiment). 12 hours are requested from the Swedish time for this 
purpose.
