notes
Our purpose is to calculate the Joule heating rates in the F region and to study
the thermospheric response, e.g., neutral wind and neutral temperature.

The UHF CP2 experiment will be run to calculate the Joule heating rates.
Simultaneously, the FPI will keep measuring the 630.0 nm emission line to
estimate the neutral wind and the neutral temperature in the F region.
