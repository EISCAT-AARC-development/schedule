notes
This EISCAT experiment covers Swarm A and C (values for C in brackets) passing 
over TRO at 22:16:57(22:17:13) UT, h=462.7(9) km, r=482.2(470.1) km, 
Az=279.8(278.4) deg, El=73.0(79.5) deg.

Because of expected low density the VHF is requested which hopefully can get 
good data at Swarm altitude, but at some distance from the closest approach of 
the satellites.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Three Swarm satellites, A, B, and C, perform high precision magnetic field
measurements using both vector and scalar magnetometers. The
instrumentation includes a thermal ion imager (TII) and Langmuir probe
(LP). Together the LP and TII form the electric field instruments
(EFIs). The PI is David Knudsen <knudsen@ucalgary.ca> from the University of 
Calgary. For LP contact Stephan Buchert <scb@irfu.se>. Using EFI data electron 
density and temperature, ion drift vector and temperature and the perpendicular 
electric field can be derived. In addition accelerometer instruments, onboard 
GPS receivers and ground-based laser ranging of Swarm support a very precise 
orbit determination.
