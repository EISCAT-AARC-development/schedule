notes
We aim at investigating variations of ion temperature and electric field in
the F-region (Thermosphere) in order to understand more deeply the basic
state of the polar Thermosphere as well as the coupling between
Magnetosphere-Ionosphere-Thermosphere in the polar region. We run the Tromso UHF radar and ESR.
PI is Prof Fujiwara.   We have requested 4 days, but we will only two days out of the 4 days.
