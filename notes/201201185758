notes
The aim of this experiment is to test empirically, for the first time, the 
Carlson 2007 theory which proposes that the thermospheric response to transient 
heating events near the cusp is responsible for ionospheric patch production.

Our planned radar mode is a windscreen wiper meridional scan with the 32m dish, 
interspersed with 42m field-aligned measurements. At the same time, the UCL FPI 
and SCANDI (an all-sky FPI) will make measurements of neutral temperatures and 
winds at ~120km and 240km altitude, as well as the green and red line emission 
intensities (though the intensities are not calibrated). The UCL team will be 
Anasuya Aruliah, Ian McWhiter and Amy Ronksley. They will also be involved in 
running the optical instruments. The experiment is a  collaboration with Joeren 
Moen and Herb Carlson, who will also both be present.

The over-scheduling allows for the fact that there will be cancellations and 
schedule changes, based on weather conditions and scheduling conflicts - 
including possible conflicts with the stratospheric warming campaign. 

Both the CUSP-N and the Norwegian patch tracking experiment require the same 
conditions, and scheduling will be agreed during the campaign.  The CUSP-N data 
will also be open for use by the Southampton group.
