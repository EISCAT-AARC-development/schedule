notes
This is a request for EISCAT mainland (VHF) time to support observations by the 
University of Oulu KAIRA facility in October 2013.  The experimenter is Poppy 
Martin from the University of Southampton, UK - supervisor Anna Scaife.  The 
main aim of the campaign is to test the potential use of KAIRA as an imaging 
riometer through the measurement of ionospheric absorption.  The VHF experiment 
will probably be a standard D-region mode with vertical pointing, in order to 
compare energetic particle measurements at Tromso with those inferred from the 
riometric measurements made by KAIRA.  Twelve hours (3x4 hour runs) are being 
requested, though slots may be moved or cancelled depending on conditions.
