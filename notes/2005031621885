notes
March sees the best configuration for Cluster cusp passes during 2005, and as 
such is one of the two most favourable months for EISCAT/Cluster experiments.  
The Cluster orbit plane is pretty much in the direction of the Sun-Earth line 
during the early part of the month, evolving slowly duskward as the month goes 
on.  We are requesting four EISCAT runs in support of Cluster, all of which 
correspond to possible cusp conjunctions. The best intervals are those on the 
9th and 28th, but the conjunctions of the 16th and 4th might be just as good, 
depending on solar-terrestrial conditions. We request the normal operation, 
namely a combination of low-elevation tau1 experiments on the VHF and the 
standard Cluster operation (based on tau0) on the ESR, using both dishes with 
the steerable dish in LowElNorth mode, and dumping interleaved between the two 
dishes (1:1, i.e. one dump on each).
