notes
The goals of the proposed observations would be to study artificially-pumped
Langmuir and upper hybrid turbulence at high time and frequency resolution in
both the ion-acoustic and Langmuir (up and down-shifted
plasma line) ISR spectra.
The proposed observations would use a new ESR observation program jointly
developed by Brett Isham (PI on this proposal) and Paul Gallop (formerly at the
Rutherford-Appleton Laboratory EISCAT support group in the UK). This program
would be an adaptation of the lt2 program developed and used by Brett Isham
and collaborators on the EISCAT VHF radar, and is somewhat simlar to the lt4
program used by Strømme et al. (2005) which also was developed from the same lt2
VHF code.
If conditions are poor or excessive scheduling conflicts exist during the
mid-day hours, it may be possible to negotiate time-sharing, to find appropriate
conditions with sufficiently large fOF2 during times before or after midday,
and/or to search for active conditions during other periods of the day. We would
hope however that a significant fraction of the of the hours could be run during
or near mid-day (local noon) and when conditions are favorable.
