notes
The object of this experiment is to study the ionospheric signqatures of ULF    
waves in artificially induced radar backscatter, in conjunction with the CUTLASS   
Radar and the Leicester Doppler sounder. For this the Heater will be operated continuously in a reduced power mode. The UHF Radar beam will be kept aligned with the magnetic field line. It is expected to employ the CP-1L pulse code, but   
it is possible that the tau2 pulse code might be used instead.
