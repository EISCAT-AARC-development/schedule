notes
This is a request for ESR operations in support of the UCL Scanning Doppler 
Imager, which is currently operational in the new Kjell Henriksson 
observatory.  The aim is to run the experiment three times, for six hours each 
time, during the interval from January 4th to 13th.  Two of these runs should 
take place during the cusp interval (05-11 UT) and the third in the midnight 
sector (19-01 UT).

The experiment is over-booked because it requires cloud-free conditions.  
Eoghan Griffin and Anasuya Aruliah will be on Svalbard from January 4th to 13th 
and can advise on whether conditions are suitable if there is any doubt.

The default experiment is a small scan with three positions, one of which is 
field-aligned with the other two having elevations of 63.5 degrees north and 
south.  More complex scans may be used if justified by the conditions, but this 
would require good SNR at the ESR.
