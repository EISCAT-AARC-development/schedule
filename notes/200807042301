notes
The HF facility and UHF radar will be used to investigate the development of the
magnetic zenith effect in F-region heating.

The UHF and heater beams will be scanned between vertical and field-aligned. The
experiment will be dependent of foF2 being sufficiently high to permit F-region
heating.
