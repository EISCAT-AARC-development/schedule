notes
Modification of CP-3, with antenna to "track" selected GPS satellites. Will analyse data for TEC and N_e-gradients and compare with TEC and scintillations observed by GPS receivers. We apply for 30 Norwegian and 30 Swedish SP-hours. We plan a total of 10 runs of 6 hours each in the time period April-June. I ask for assistance to programme antenna movements. Similar application from Sweden.
