For January 2006, we are requesting four EISCAT/Cluster runs, as follows:

January 13th  1000-1400 UT
January 18th  0600-1000 UT
January 24th  2300-0300 UT (25th)
January 25th  0800-1200 UT

The runs on the 13th, 18th and the second run on the 25th were identified by 
Jackie Davies.  The run on the 24th/25th is in support of a perigee pass, for 
which coverage was requested by Ingrid Sandahl.

The Cluster orbit axis is evolving from the dawn-dusk plane towards the noon-
midnight plane.  We have not yet reached the time of the best cusp conjunctions 
(from late Feb) but observations in previous years have shown that cusp 
conjunctions can occur even in this time sector under unusual IMF conditions.

The configuration should be VHF northward-looking tau1 (along boresight) with 
ESR LowElNorth for the runs of Jan 13, 18 and 25 (second run).  For the run of 
January 24/25, we could use LowElSouth on the ESR 32m dish, since the 
conjunction primarily takes place over northern Scandinavia.  (I will confirm 
this with Ingrid).

For all ESR experiments, some level of inter-leaving between the 32m and 42m 
dishes would be acceptable, e.g 4:1 (32m:42m) but the main focus should be on 
preserving the quality of the 32m data which is needed to give good latitudinal 
coverage.
