notes
The Svalbard Radar will monitor the ionospheric conditions during conjugate 
overpassses of the FAST spacecraft. The fixed (42m) antenna will primarily be 
used, as field-aligned measurements are principally required. It is possible, 
however, that the steerable (32m) will also be used. The radar will operated 
using the tau0 pulse code.
