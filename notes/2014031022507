notes
Radar, radio, and optical observations of naturally-enhanced emissions (ion-acoustic, Langmuir, radio, 
and 
optical waves) conducted near local midnight. Both VHF (22:00-02:00 UT) and UHF (22:00-02:00 UT) 
Tromsø radars will be used to monitor the ionosphere (90-1200 km). VHF and UHF radars will be 
operated 
4 hours per night with antennas directed to zenith using lt1v and lt1t control programs. Radio emission 
data will be recorded using a wide-band (0-10 MHz) receiver provided by Dartmouth College. Optical 
data 
will be recorded by collaborators operating instruments in and near Tromso.
