notes
The objective with the experiment is to do frequency-sweeping experiments  with
EISCAT Heating at full power close to and several 100 kHz away from multiples of
the double resonance to to investigate the altitude variation of enhanced ion
and plasma-lines during day-time and night-time conditions and the altitude
variation of artificial aurora (night-time only). The EISCAT UHF radar will be
used to both observe the HF-modified ionospheric back-scatter spectra at both
ion and plasma-lines and to monitor the thermal ionospheric response and use the
ALIS optical system to observe the three-dimensional distribution of artificial
aurora. UHF will be operated in magnetic zenith with the beata program.
The evening experiments will be run under the condition of optically clear skies and
cancellations of the experiments will be done.
