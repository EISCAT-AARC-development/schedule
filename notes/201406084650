notes
The objective is to test new receiver/sampling technologies developed in the E3D preparatory phase 
project by UO/SGO and some Finnish companies. The receivers will be installed in Kilpisj‰rvi in conjunction 
with KAIRA facility. In addition, KAIRA will be used as a receiver also. In experiment, we aim to use some 
long pulses and VHF radar.
