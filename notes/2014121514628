Designed to exploit the high‐latitude dark skies near winter solstice. All
proposals will be considered and operating modes for each facility will be
designed to maximize the scientific goals of the interested parties. In
particular, we expect to focus on SED, SAPS, and patch evolution, among other
topics as requested.
