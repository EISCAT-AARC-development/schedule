notes
For May 2005, we are requesting three EISCAT runs in support of Cluster.  One 
of these (May 2nd 16-22) is to cover an auroral perigee pass over Scandinavia, 
the other two (May 17 04-10 UT and May 29 03-09 UT) are to cover boundary-
crossing orbits where the magnetic footprint of the Cluster satellites is 
conjugate to Svalbard.  Because the orientation of the orbit is now moving 
towards orthogonal to the Sun-Earth line, this month is not the highest 
priority period for EISCAT-Cluster operations.
The preferred mode is the standard one for EISCAT/Cluster operations, namely 
northward-looking VHF, accompanied by dual radar ESR operations, with the 32m 
dish in LowElNorth mode and the 42m dish field-aligned, with data dumps being 
alternated (1:1) between the two dishes.
