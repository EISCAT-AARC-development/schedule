notes
This is unusual experiment. It WILL BE ONLY RUN if conditions are suitable 
for PMWE during high-speed solar wind streams (and no SPE), when PMWE has 
been observed by nearby MST radars  Esrad and Maarsy. 
The VHF radar will run tristatic manda experiment  where Tromso VHF radar is pointed vertically, and K 
and S receivers is pointed to the PMWE height above Tromso.
