notes
These measurements are connected to a rocket launch at Esrange, Sweden. While 
this request covers the time period August 15-25, we will only need 
approximatetly half of these days, depending of the exact timing of the rocket 
launch. Cancellation of dates that are not needed will be made at latest on the 
previous working day. We thus request 5 days with 4 hours of measurements each 
(19-23 UT), i.e. a total of 20 hours Swedish EISCAT time.

Measurement hours connected to a first rocket launch in the first half of 
August are requested separately (experiment name OSTATES 1).

A scientific motivation for these EISCAT measurements has been sent to Stephan 
Buchert as Swedish representative.
