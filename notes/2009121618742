notes
We want to study processes taking place within the auroral oval, at the polar cap boundary and even 
within the polar cap, like:
- Reconnection (determination ofthe reconnection electric field)
- Poleward boundary intensifications (PBIs), auroral streamers and fast flows
- Drift of F-region polar cap patches across the nightside auroral oval boundary and the effects of that 
to the boundary
