notes
The purpose of the experiments is to train Ukrainian scientists in as many 
aspects of the EISCAT radar as possible at the Ramfjord site - understanding the 
radar experiments and data acquisition, running experiments and analyzing the 
recorded data. This experiment will also include coordinated heater experiments 
for  investigating ionospheric irregularities though observations of discrete 
cosmic source scintillations using KAIRA facility. Another purpose of the 
experiment is studying the scattering of signals from the EISCAT heater at 
ionospheric irregularities produced by the heater radiation itself. To that end 
we plan to monitor Doppler spectra of the heater signals at several greatly 
dispersed receiving sites.
