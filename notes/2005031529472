notes
The Svalbard Radar will monitor the ionospheric conditions during conjugate 
overpassses of the FAST spacecraft. The fixed (42m) antenna will primarily be 
used, as field-aligned measurements are principally required. It is possible, 
however, that the steerable (32m) will also be used. Please note that the time 
interval for this booking has been chosen on the basis of orbital predictions 
of the FAST satellite. These predictions may not be accurate owing to 
atmospheric drag. It might be necessary therefore to revise the booking closer 
to the time.
