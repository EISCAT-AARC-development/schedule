notes
A ULF Heater cycle will be used to modulate E-Region ionospheric conductivity and to excite large amplitude resonant Alfvenic ULF pulsations. (The latter will use modulation rates derived from near real time local Alfven eigenfrequencies estimated from magnetometer data.) EISCAT, CUTLASS, and magnetometer data will then be used to study the magnetosphere-ionosphere response.
