notes
The ESR will run the long pulse slopes experiment using the 32m dish in support
of a SPEAR heating experiment.  We will either run field aligned or scanning
through the heater patch depending on conditions.

The experiment is in run in conjunction with a recently deployed all sky camera
and photometers which will be observing any artificial aurora generated by SPEAR.
The CUTLASS radars will also be running in support of the campaign.
