notes
This experiment seeks to determine the thermospheric neutral density, topside 
anomalous electric field, and pump-induced supra-thermal electron energy by 
active experiment. The Heater and UHF radar will point field-aligned. Clear 
skies are needed to support local and remote multi-wavelength optical data. 
Expect cancellations.
