August 2008 sees the beginning of the Cluster tail season, with the optimum 
conjunctions with EISCAT occurring initially in the post-midnight sector and 
mving toward magnetic midnight as the month ends.  At the same time, the THEMIS 
constellation is oriented toward the dayside.  Conjunctions listed here have 
been chosen not only because of the position of Cluster, but also based on the 
availability of upstream THEMIS spacecraft.

The requested conjunctions are

20080817 2200 - 20080818 0200
20080819 2200 - 20080820 0200
20080826 2200 - 20080827 0200 and
20080831 2130 - 20080901 0130

Most suitable modes would be tau1 with low-elevation northward pointings on 
boresight at the VHF and LowElSouth using tau0 and perhaps 4:1 interleaving 
between the 32m and 42m dishes.
