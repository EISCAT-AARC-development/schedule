notes
This experiment uses the VHF in the vertical position running the manda
experiment to look for signs of high energy precipitation in the afternoon
sector, possibly associated with relativistic electrons scattered by EMIC waves.
Active conditions are required, specifically during high speed solar wind
streams from coronal holes. Cancellation is likely if geomagnetic conditions
remain calm.
