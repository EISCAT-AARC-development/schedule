This experiment is designed to support a Cluster cusp pass identified as being 
of particular interest by the ESA Cluster Guest Investigator Programme, under 
the proposal "Mid-altitude cusp properties, dynamics, small scale plasma 
structure and ion outflow". The aim is to use the ESR32m dish pointing south, 
together with the 42m field-aligned dish and the Tromso VHF looking northward at 
low elevation.  Combining the data from these observations will provide 
information on plasma injections and dynamics inside the cusp.
