We would like to conduct the generalized auroral tomography 
observation using ALIS,  FMI imagers, NIPR imagers, and the EISCAT 
radar again this year. We are planning to apply for the EISCAT
experiments in the premidnight (18:00-23:00) around February 21-28, 
2013. So, we hope to collaborate with you.

The observation mode for each instrument that we plan is the same 
as that of last year:
- EISCAT radar: Meridian scan mode from 56 to 80 degrees elevation 
angle during a period of 30sec.
- ALIS: EISCAT south mode. 428nm for active aurora and 558nm for 
weak aurora.
- FMI and NIPR imagers: 428nm for the EMCCD imagers and 558nm for 
the other NIPR monochromatic imagers.
