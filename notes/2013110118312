notes
The scientific objectives with the experiment are:

1, studies of F-region artificial aurora/Radio-Induced Optical Emissions.
With main focus on determining the volume emission rate varies in 3-D
for emissions from atomic oxygen (6300, 5577, 8446 Å) and molecular
Nitrogen ions (4278 Å), as a function of frequency and ERP. Descending
HF-enhanced ion-lines would if observed act as another direct measure
of ionisation which would reveal how it varies with frequency and ERP.

2, studies of enhanced ion and plasma-lines in auroral E-layers, with
the ambition to determine how the aurora is affected by HF-pumping.

3, studies of generation of pulsating aurora. For this we should heat
the E region with working cycle of 10 s ON 20 OFF with amplitude
modulation at frequency of several kHz (whistler wave resonance
frequency).

Experiments will be canceled due to unfavourable ionospheric
conditions, and cloudy skies.
