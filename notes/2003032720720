notes
For March 2003, I am requesting five Cluster intervals. Four of these are possible cusp conjunctions, the fifth is an auroral perigee pass. As in previous years, March is the month containing the best Cluster cusp encounters for EISCAT/ESR, making this one of the most imprtant months for good coverage.

The five intervals are:     March  3rd  8-12 UT  (ESR only)
                            March  8th  6-12 UT  (ESR+VHF)
                            March 15th  6-12 UT  (ESR+VHF)
                            March 27th  5-11 UT  (ESR+VHF)
                            March 31st 18-24 UT  (ESR+VHF)

For the 8th and 15th, 27th and 31st the experiment should be the "classic" Cluster orientation, namely fixed Low Elevation North on the ESR, interleaved (1:1) with field-aligned observations and tau1avsingle on the mainland VHF.
On the 3rd the geometry is not so good for the mainland sites, and the VHF has in any case been requested for another experiment, so I am only requesting tau0 on that day.
Comments and queries welcome !
