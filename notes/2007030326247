notes
This experiment is intended to provide radar support for the new Svalbard 
Scanning Doppler Imager (SCANDI) instrument belonging to UCL, which is now 
installed in the Adventdalen observatory.

These experiments will use the standard ESR CP2.  Clear conditions are 
required, hence three runs have been requested to allow some flexibility - it 
is intended to run these experiments on two nights.

The requested slot runs from 19 to 05 UT on each of three nights (March 01/02, 
02/03 and 03/04) coinciding with the SPEAR campaign and the long IPY run.

Since the planned experiment is CP2, it is anticipated that this experiment 
will easily satisfy the minimum cadence requirement on field-aligned 
observations demanded by the IPY run.

The UK allocates 20 hours to the UK-SCANDI experiments in March, which is 
addditional to the time allocated for the similar experiments at the end of 
February.
