notes
Development of polarization electric field due to artificial, sudden changes of 
ionospheric parameters by the EISCAT Heating facility

Here we propose an EISCAT heating experiment along with KST UHF observations 
for understanding the nature of the magnetosphere-ionosphere (M-I) coupling, in 
particular, of the electric field in the polar 
ionosphere.

EISCAT heater: 
The carrier frequency is set close to the plasma frequency around 110 km high.
The sequence of the on-off of the heater is 10 min on and 10 min off. (the 
traveling time of the Alfven wave between M and I is a few minutes, so within 
10 min saturation to reach an equilibrium state can be expected)

EISCAT UHF radar:
Multi-points Arc mode. The remote antennae point the common volume around 280 
km. The EISCAT UHF radar can measure only one line of sight at one time and 
cannot provide any information in other regions. It is therefore very important 
to check if the spatial and temporal development of the enhanced region by the 
heater and those of physical parameters have quantitative reappearance.
