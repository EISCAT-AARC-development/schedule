notes
We aim at investigating variations of ion temperature and electric field in
the F-region (Thermosphere) in order to understand more deeply the basic
state of the polar Thermosphere as well as the coupling between
Magnetosphere-Ionosphere-Thermosphere in the polar region. We run the Tromso UHF radar and ESR.
PI is Prof Fujiwara. The mode of ESR depends on the conditions of the ESR. We like to scan the antenna.
