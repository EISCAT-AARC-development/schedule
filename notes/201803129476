The proposed experiment is a continuation of previous campaigns which 
provided (a) an inter-calibration between EISCAT and GNSS Total Electron 
Content [1] and (b) the identification of properties of auroral ionisation 
structures originating L-band scintillation [2]. Following from (b), the 
proposed experiment intends to advance the understanding of the mechanisms 
behind large-to-small scale structures in the auroral ionosphere and how 
they originate scintillation at VHF (LOFAR) and L-band (GNSS) as well as 
clutter on HF backscattered power (SuperDARN). While in previous campaigns 
the EISCAT radars were co-aligned towards a given GNSS satellite, this time 
(owing to the experience gained) the radars beams will be intersecting given 
ray paths (to both GNSS satellites and fixed radio sources). The objective 
is to determine the spatial spectrum of irregularities and how this is 
related to the scattering that originates scintillation at VHF and L-band as 
well as clutter at HF.

Details of the scan and modulation will be added once the schedule requests 
are confirmed.
