notes
We are setting up a new experimental campaign to collect more data on the pola
polarisation of the auroral emissions. We will use two instruments; the first one 
one is a spectropolarimeter that has been already used in 2016 and 2017. The seco
second one is a simpler instrument under development, that will be tested for the 
the first time to monitor the polarisation of the red line only.

A program devoted to this has been developped in March 2016 (/
(/kst/exp/scans/kst/fr/polarlis_pattern.elan) by J. Lilensten and Arild, from EI
EISCAT. This program was used in 2016 but unfortunately in cloudy conditions, wh
which did not allow to couple with our optical measurements. 
However, it was succesfully tested. It scans along the polarimeters line of s
sight in a successions of 7 elevations (from 30 to 60 degrees) and then back, i
i.e. 12 positions in a full cycle. Each position is monitored during 60 s
seconds. This code will be used again during the 2018 experiment campaign.


EISCAT data will allow us to monitor the state of the ionosphere and better u
understand the physics of the auroral polarisation.  We will also complement t
the polarimetric observations with optical observations from the ALIS network.
