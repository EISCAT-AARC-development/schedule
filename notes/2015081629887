In order to study the connection between PMSE and NLC we intend to 
simultaneously observe PMSE and NLC at about the same volume in space using two 
optical cameras at Kiruna and Nikkaluokta and the EISCAT VHF in Tromsö. Optical 
NLC observation conditions from Kiruna are better later in the summer. The NLC 
cameras will be automatically run each night from the beginning until the end 
of August.

Requested observation: 
VHF tri-static observations during 4 hours around midnight ideally during 6 
nights in the beginning of August and 6 nights in the end/middle of August. The 
scheduling is suggested by Ingemar Häggström and the observation plan was also 
discussed with Jörg Gumbel. 

We intend to make measurements even if the O-states campaign is cancelled, 
since our observations are not directly linked. In that case the scheduling is 
more flexible during the whole month of August.

A scientific motivation for these EISCAT measurements has been approved by 
Stephan Buchert as Swedish representative.
