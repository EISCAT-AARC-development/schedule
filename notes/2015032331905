notes
The VHF radar will run the standard "manda" program for different pointing
positions such as 90�, 80�, 70�. 

If echo is strong it is desirable to use remote Rx. 
The experiment WILL BE ONLY RUN if conditions are suitable for PMWE, e.g.
electron/proton precipitation to enhance the D-region and/or if PMWE has been
observed by other radars like Esrad and Maarsy.
