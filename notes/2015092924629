notes
We plan to use EISCAT heater to excite travelling ionospheric disturbances 
(TIDs). These wave processes will be studied using ISR radars located in Norway 
(EISCAT UHF radar located in Ramfjordmoen) and Ukraine (radar of the Institute 
of Ionosphere situated near Kharkiv city). The coherent HF receivers located in 
Tromso and Kharkiv (Ukraine) will be used as well. The EISCAT heater will 
transmit pump waves with O-mode polarization and be operated in long cycles (30 
min on, 30 min off). The heater frequency will be changed from about 5.5 to 7.9 
MHz to be approximately equal to the upper hybrid resonance frequency near the 
F2-peak. The effective radiated power will increase from 650 to 1250 MW being 
dependent on pump frequency. Using such operation mode, we anticipate the 
strong effects of high power HF radio wave on the F2 region to be produced. The 
results obtained will permit to identify TIDs induced by high-power radio 
waves, estimate their parameters and specify possible mechanisms for TIDs 
generation in modified region. The observations will be conducted in the 
framework of SIU Project “Harmonization of the Norwegian-Ukrainian educational 
activities in geospace researches” (CPEALA-2014/10001). According to the 
working plan of this project Maryna Siusiuk, who is PhD student from National 
Technical University “Kharkiv Polytechnic Institute” will take part in the 
preparation of the schedule of the campaign and run IS radar at EISCAT site.
