notes
We request a test setup for the first quadriphase-coded incoherent scatter experiment with EISCAT UHF. A 
new experiment with quadriphase coding and EISCAT raw data sampling will be designed in co-operation 
with J. Markkanen. Voltage level USRP sampling will be used in parallel with the EISCAT recording.
