Magnetopause Skimming               
              
06/11/2001   12-18 UT              
11/11/2001   09-15 UT              
13/11/2001   10-16 UT              
              
Magnetopause Crossing              
              
20/11/2001   09-15 UT              
27/11/2001   09-15 UT              
              
We also discussed two further intervals earlier in the month, when the              
Cluster orbit is nominally still well within the magnetopause - but              
I guess these intervals could contain auroral oval crossings, depending               
on geomagnetic activity. These were:              
              
03/11/2001  14-20 UT              
05/11/2001  06-12 UT              
              
All of the above intervals (except for 27/11) are being covered by              
SUPERDARN.              
              
Since this month isn't one of the highest priority intervals for               
EISCAT/Cluster operations we thought it very likely that not all of              
these suggestions would be taken up, so I've made some attempt to              
prioritise them. My suggested priority order would be:              
              
13th,11th,6th,20th,27th,5th and 3rd in that order.              
              
In general the Cluster footprint is North of the ESR and since we're              
now moving away from the midnight sector, my suggestion would be for              
cp4-type dual-beam (tau1) geometry on the VHF and LowElNorth (tau0) on               
the ESR with the usual interleaving between the dishes.  I think the real              
requirement is for ESR and VHF, though it might be good to include the               
UHF at low elevation if the VHF is phased for boresight.              
              
There is some small overlap between these intervals and the UK/German              
heating campaign, which might easily be resolved by not using the UHF              
for the Cluster operations. The only other conflict is on the 13/11              
when CP4 is scheduled on the ESR and VHF, which I guess means that              
the ESR will be looking southward at this time.  As I said I'd prefer              
LowElNorth, but I don't really have a strong objection, so I'll              
leave it for others to comment.
