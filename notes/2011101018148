notes
We will continue studies contrasting O/X-mode heating effects in the over- 
and underdense ionosphere F region under different direction of the HF beam. 
Behavior of artificial  small-scale field-aligned irregularities, electron 
density and  temperature  will be studied. Experiments will be carried out from 
5 October to 12 October every day from 13 to 19 UT by using the HF heating 
facility (HEA) and Tromso UHF radar (TRO). The experiments to be cancelled due 
to unsuitable ionospheric conditions or can be moved on earlier or later hours 
from 13 and 19 UT.
