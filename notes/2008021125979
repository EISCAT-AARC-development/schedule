notes
This request is for the TOI experiment, which is an elevation scan in support 
of tomographic measurements by the Aberystwyth network of beacon satellite 
receivers.  These experiment should run twice during the campaign for six hours 
(18-24 UT on February 11 and 14).  The TOI experiment uses both 
mainland and ESR, and does not depend on conditions. The experiment is 
identical to that run during the December 2007 campaign.
