notes
The experiment is aimed at investigating the scattering of signals from the 
EISCAT heater at ionospheric irregularities produced by the heater radiation 
itself. To that end we plan to monitor Doppler spectra of the heater signals at 
several greatly dispesed receiving sites in Europe and the USA. Along with the 
heating frequency we plan to radiate two probe signals of a reduced power close 
to the first and second harmonic of the heater
