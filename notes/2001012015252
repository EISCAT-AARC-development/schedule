notes
We propose a comprehensive campaign to study polar cap and polar cap boundary            
layer phenonena.  Many properties of Polar Cap Ionospheric Patches are known,            
but their origin is at best only poorly understood.              
            
Several mechanisms have been proposed for the formation of polar cap patches.              
The critical question is to find out which one(s) dominate(s).  We also aim             
to study how polar cap sun-aligned arcs rterminate at their dayside extreme.              
            
We propose an experiment to for the first time measure and analyse a             
comprehensive data set the ~50% of sun-aligned arcs that occur when the IMF is             
northward.  This requires a comprehensive data set of physical parameters             
to observe the optical, electrodynamic, and thermal/energetic and optical of             
arcs, taken near/at their interface to the dayside auroral boundary.  The             
EISCAT Svalbard Radar (ESR) is key.  A chain of ground based ASIPs will be             
operated at Longyearbyen, NyAlesund, Quaanaaqu, Nord , and at Heis Island.              
A chain of HF digisondes and satellite radio beacon receivers will coincide             
with the key ASIP locations.             
            
Clear skies above NyAlesund or Longyearbyen will be required for operating             
the ESR.  The ESR antennas will be operated in a set of different modes             
appropriate for the actual geophysical activity level.
