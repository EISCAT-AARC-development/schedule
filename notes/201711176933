notes
The main purpose is to study the magnetic zenith effect during ordinary mode HF
pumping of the quiet ionospheric plasma, especially possible L-mode propagation
to bring about the self focusing of the pump wave. The pump frequency needs to
be below the ionospheric critical frequency. The experiments are supported by
optical measurements of the ALIS system (IRF, Kiruna). In the event of not too
intense auroral activity, pump-induced perturbations in the vicinity of auroral
arcs will be attempted.
