Recent studies using SuperDARN radars have shown intriguing 
relationships between pulsating aurora and changes in E region 
auroral backscatter. On the one hand, regular pulsations are 
associated with periodic changes in echo Doppler shift. 
On the other, irregular pulsations are associated with a new 
population of low altitude (D-region) backscatter echoes. 
We aim to investigate these two phenomena with simultaneous 
observations of the aurora by TV cameras and Reimei satellite, 
and electron density measurement by EISCAT radar in Tromsoe.

Beata or manda pulse code will be used for the Tromso UHF 
radar observation. We prefer good weather condition for the 
optical observations.
