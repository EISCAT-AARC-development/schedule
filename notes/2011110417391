notes
We plan to continue studies of contrasting O/X-mode heating effects in the over-
and underdense ionosphere F region using the SPEAR heating facility,
specifically the behavior of artificial small-scale field-aligned
irregularities. The experiments are in collaboration with colleagues at AARI and
also supported by optical observations at Barentsburg and magnetic pulsation
data in the frequency range of 1-10 Hz. HF Doppler observations will also be
made using the research station at Gorkovskaya.
The time has been slightly overbooked with cancellations taking place due to
unsuitable ionospheric conditions.
The beata code should be run with both dishes pointing FA.
