notes
We wish to observe ionospheric dynamics and transients due to dayside solar
wind-magnetosphere coupling processes taking place at magnetopause
(reconnection, sudden impulses, etc.). The ESR 32m will point at low elevation
towards the North or the South depending on the orientation of the IMF and 42m
dish will observe field aligned. We shall favour, anytime we have suitable solar
wind/IMF conditions, configurations where the ESR 32m points due south so that
we have can cover the open-closed field line boundary. Besides, possible
coordinated measurements with the THEMIS spacecraft orbiting near the
magnetopause may be performed.
