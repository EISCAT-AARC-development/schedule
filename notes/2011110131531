notes
The experiment is aimed at investigating the scattering of signals from the 
EISCAT heater at ionospheric irregularities produced by the heater radiation 
itself. To that end we plan to monitor Doppler spectra of the heater signals at 
several greatly dispersed receiving sites in Tromso, Svalbard, Ukraine, Siberia 
and Antarctica. Another issue is investigating the enhancement of natural ion 
acoustic spectral lines
