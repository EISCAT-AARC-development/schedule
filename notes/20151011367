This EISCAT experiment covers Swarm A and C (values for C in brackets) passing 
over TRO at 11:00:08(00) UT, h=461.9 km, r=476.7(493.9) km

Az=80.8 (79.4) deg, El=75.1 (68.5) deg
======================================

The UHF antenna should be pointing to Az=80.8, El=75.1

SWARM B passes over Troms√∏ at 14:11:11 UT, h=518.7 km, r=578.4. The antenna 
pointing 1400-1430 UT should be Az=270.5 deg and El=62.6 deg

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Three Swarm satellites, A, B, and C, perform high precision magnetic field
measurements using both vector and scalar magnetometers. The
instrumentation includes a thermal ion imager (TII) and Langmuir probe
(LP). Together the LP and TII form the electric field instruments
(EFIs). The PI is David Knudsen <knudsen@ucalgary.ca> from the University of 
Calgary. For LP contact Stephan Buchert <scb@irfu.se>. Using EFI data electron 
density and temperature, ion drift vector and temperature and the perpendicular 
electric field can be derived. In addition accelerometer instruments, onboard 
GPS receivers and ground-based laser ranging of Swarm support a very precise 
orbit determination.
