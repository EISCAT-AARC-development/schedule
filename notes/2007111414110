notes
This experiment is part of a UK programme to measure the ionospheric effects of 
fast solar wind streams emanating from coronal holes.  The experiment uses both 
the UHF and VHF radars, with the UHF running in low elevation mode (30 degrees) 
along the geographic north meridian (tau1) while the VHF runs a D-layer mode 
(arc_dlayer) pointing vertically.

The scheduling is based on the prediction of when an active solar wind stream 
will impact the Earth based on previous solar rotations. An improved prediction 
will be available after October 18th, after which the run will either be 
confirmed, cancelled, or moved slightly to match the nominal arrival time of 
the solar wind stream.
