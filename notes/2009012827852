notes
This is a joint UK/Norwegian campaign to study the black aurora with both radar 
and optics. The Tromso UHF radar will operate monostatically in CP1 mode. 
Optical observations will be made from Ramfjord and from other camera sites 
deployed in the local area. Clear conditions are required, and the experiment 
is over-booked to allow for some cancellation.  The experimenters are happy to 
give way to the DELTA2 rocket experiment if launch conditions are favourable 
for the rocket.
