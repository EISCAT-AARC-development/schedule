notes
After exciting results in November 2001, this is a multi-national campaign involving optical instruments from UK, SW/NI, FI to observe optical emissions from energetic electrons caused by HF-heating of the F-region (or E-region). Simultaneous plasma/ion line enhancements will be attempted with VHF, HF SEE observations, and other coherent radar measurements.                     
VHF desired single beam (unphased).                     
Preliminary time distribution:
