notes
For understanding the generation mechanism(s) of the polar cap arcs we suggest combined ground-
based auroral observations and IS radar measurements for the following objectives: 
1. Comparison the drift motion of PC arcs with the ionospheric plasma drift velocity in F-region; 
2. Inferring the electric field and field-aligned currents associated with the arcs. 
The experiment was initiated at the “Polar Cap Arcs” research team meeting in the International Space 
Science Institute (ISSI), in 2013.
In the case if favorable conditions (Northward IMF) will not occur in the course of the experiment, the 
collected data may be well utilized for studying the polar cap patches (which typically occurs during 
Southward IMF).

ESR-32m: El.= 45 deg., Az= -68 and -23 (swinging, 2 min at each position); 
ESR-42m: Field-aligned; 
Possible radar operation mode is “taro”.
