notes
In the design of the EISCAT 3D, a potential heating effect of the radar itself, "self-heating", must be taken 
into account. The purpose of this experiment is to try to quantify the self-heating effect with the present 
VHF system and to imitate the expected self-heating effects of EISCAT_3D by using the EISCAT heater.
