notes
We have 4 unused hours from last year and 6 hours in 2017 from the French participation. Last year we 
could not use our hours because we were in priority 2 most of the time, which actually means no exp. 
That is an uncomfortable situation for us. We would like to use the 10 hours in 3 nights, respectively 3, 
3 and 4 hours when the moon and the sun are 18° below the horizon, i.e. between 22 LT and 4 LT. The 
3 nights do not need to be contiguous and can be scattered any time between March, 4th and March 9. 
If we cannot use the 10 hours, please tell us enough in advance so that we cancel several participants. 
Thank you and … Happy new year !
