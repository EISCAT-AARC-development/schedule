notes
Concerning the VHF radar operation which we plan to run on July 6 and 7         
(together with ESR 42 m), we have the following two requests  in order to          
observe the "SAME" common volume with the ESR 42 m  at two altitudes of          
665 and 800 km. This is a kind of extension of our previous SP (see Ogawa          
et al.,  GRL, 27, 81-84, 2000).         
         
First, we like to steer the VHF radar beam about 4.7 degrees to the west of          
north. Second, we like to operate two panels with an elevation angle of 30.0         
degrees to the north and the rest of panels with an elevation angle of 37.9          
degrees to the north.          
         
It is very  essential to observe the SAME common volume with ESR and VHF radars.
