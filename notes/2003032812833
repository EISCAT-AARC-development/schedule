notes
We are requesting three short break-in experiments into the March UHF common programme to cover overpasses of TIMED.  This experiment would be a collaboration with Phil Anderson at Aerospace Corp and could be run automatically by using a modified elan file for the Common Programme as was done in November and December last year.  The times of the break-ins would be:

0020-0050 UT March 26th
0040-0110 UT March 27th
0050-0120 UT March 28th

Suitable ELAN files already exist at Tromso (created by Paul Gallop last year) and would only need minor modification
