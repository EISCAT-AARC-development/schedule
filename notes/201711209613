notes
The EISCAT Svalbard Radar 32m dish and the Svalbard SuperDARN radar scans will be 
synchronized within a common scattering volume. 
With this we will study the structure and evolution of ionospheric Flow Channels 
(FC), which are small-scale (~100km wide) velocity enhancements of >1km/s within 
the background convection flow.

*NOTE* We have 40 confirmed SW hours but are awaiting confirmation for another 10 
and should receive before November.
