Notes:   
   
The skimming orbits at the beginning of July seem to be naturals for   
EISCAT/Sondy collaboration, as the footprint moves west with time,   
allowing Sondy to pick up the baton when the footprint is too far from   
EISCAT.  EISCAT can probably use the "normal" Cluster mode, as the   
footprint is either just north of, or above, Svalbard.  I'd probably   
prioritise these in date order (i.e. 2nd the best, 9th the worst).   
   
I am assuming that we will only have single-beam VHF in July, because   
of the PMSE campaigns.   
   
The August 3rd interval is close to perigee, with the footprint moving   
from the Kola peninsula to north of Greenland.  It co-incides with a    
long Cluster burst mode.   
   
The August 13/14 interval is covered by a long EISCAT Common programme.   
The Cluster footprint passes between Svalbard and the Norwegian mainland   
so it might be best for ESR to look south - the interval on the 25th/26th   
is the same.  The footprint subsequently moves west over Greenland,    
potentially allowing Sondy to pick up the baton.   
   
The August 15th interval has a footprint moving from Novaya Zemlya to   
north of Greenland.  Again it co-incides with a long burst mode on    
Cluster.  "Normal" EISCAT mode might be OK for this.   
   
The August 25/26th interval is similar to that of the 13th/14th.   
   
There are a number of other passes that I could have picked, but I've   
chosen those that seem to be good candidates for co-ordination between   
EISCAT and Sondy and those perigee passes close to EISCAT with long   
Cluster burst modes.   
   
Other passes that I considered were....   
   
July 15/16  22-09  (EISCAT+Sondy)   
August 6/7  22-02  (EISCAT)   
August 21   02-06  (Sondy)   
August 29   12-18  (Sondy)   
   
...but I'm reluctant to ask for too much, partly because of the pressure   
on EISCAT time, and partly because the orbit plane will be even better   
later in the autumn.
