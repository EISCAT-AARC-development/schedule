notes
For November 2003, I am requesting only three experiments in support of 
Cluster.  The tail conjunction is by now effectively over, though the interval 
requested on the 1st is predicted to co-incide with the last plasma sheet 
crossing on the nightside.  As the month goes on, the orientation of the orbit 
rotates with respect to the Earth, to become almost orthogonal to the Sun-Earth 
line by the month's end.  This means that there will be some orbits where the 
spacecraft may skim the magnetopause close to apogee around the middle of the 
month, while late in the month there are clear magnetopause crossings.

The three requested intervals are as follows:

November 1  14-20 UT  (plasma sheet crossing)
November 4  10-16 UT  (possible skim near magnetopause)
November 15 04-10 UT  (perigee pass near dayside oval)

None of these are sufficiently high priority to interrupt experiments which are 
already scheduled, so I propose using only thoe radars which happen to be 
available, i.e. VHF for the 1st and 15th, ESR for the 4th.
