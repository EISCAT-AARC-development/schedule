notes
(The HTVIT trough PP runs are additionaly requested because 
ionosphere was mostly quiet between 17 October and 03 November.)

EROS commands:
run /kst/exp/ni/beata/beata fm sweep8925s
enablerec


In order to investigate rapid variations of plasma 
parameters inside/outside ionospheric trough during 
storm/substorm, we conduct the EISCAT special 
observations with high speed meridional scan which 
takes only 80 seconds from 25 to 89 degrees. 
It is preferable to run the observations under 
disturbed geomagnetic condition.
