notes
Special SD-receiver will be used to sample the EISCAT signal on the IF2 level 
(11MHz) at the Tromsö site. Standard EISCAT receivers and DSP will be used at 
the remote sites. Standard EISCAT experiments (with fixed antenna pointing) 
will be used at the Tromsö site and the modified versions of the same 
experiments at the remotes.
