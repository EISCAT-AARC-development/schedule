This experiment aims at examining variations of the temperature between 80 and
110 km due to aurora effect (from above) and atmospheric wave effect (from
below). Clear sky and aurora activity are desired. UHF mode will be  CP-2
mode-like, but scan pattern will be different from standard ones. VHF mode will
be vertical mode (CP6-like). Collaborations of Japan and Norway.

We also conduct observations of Medium-Scale Traveling Ionospheric Disturbances
(MSTID) using the EISCAT UHF and VHF radars and European GPS networks. Antenna
directions of the UHF and VHF radars are along the magnetic field line and
vertical, respectively.
