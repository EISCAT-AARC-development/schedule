notes
The object of this investigation is to make measurements of the cusp regions of the magnetosphere during favourable conjunctions of satellite and ground-based   
instruments. It is intended to employ both Svalbard Antennas and the VHF Mainland Radar, as well as the CUTLASS radar and instruments on the IMAGE, Cluster, and Geotail satellites. (There will also be a short period of Mainland Heater operation for another experiment.) The VHF Radar will be operated in a mode similar to CP-4, while the Svalbard Steerable Antenna is expected to be kept in a constant northerly direction. The pulse codes have yet to be decided.
