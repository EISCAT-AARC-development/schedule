notes
These VHF measurements are meant to support a campaign comprising two sounding 
rockets and a comprehensive set of ground-based instruments which will be 
carried out from Andøya Rocket Range in the period 27th June to 6 July 2006. The 
purpose of the campaign is to study the mesosphere and lower ionosphere during a 
period with noctilucent clouds (NLC) and Polar Summer Mesospheric Echoes (PMSE). 
 The launches of two different rocket payloads will be coordinated in a salvo 
within a period of about 30 minutes. An additional requirement for the salvo is 
the presence of a weak to moderate auroral disturbance with particle 
precipitation in the mesopause and E-region. The two rocket payloads are 
codenamed ESPRIT and HotPay1.

·          HotPay1 is the first of two rocket projects financed by EU through 
the. This project was initiated by ALOMAR through an application to EU&#8217;s 6th 
Framework Programme. The payload has been built as part of ARR&#8217;s Hotel Payload 
Project and is instrumented by a series of European research institutions.

·         ESPRIT is a US-Norwegian student project in which students from Penn 
State University, the Universities in Oslo and Bergen as well as the Technical 
College of Narvik have built and instrumented the payload. NASA is responsible 
for the rocket configuration and Andøya Rocket Range for the launch and range 
operations. 

·         From the ground ALOMAR scientists will take part in the campaign with 
all relevant lidar and radar instruments
