notes
The MaxiDusty rocket launch window-time is between June 24th and July 10th (DoY 176-192).

The whole EISCAT VHF campaign may be cancelled if rocket campaign is cancelled.

Using MANDA program, raw data recording, TX vertical. Dates: 2016, July 1st & July 4-8th (DoY 183, 186-
190). There may be cancellations the remaining days after the rocket is launched.

There may be also the chance of monitoring the PMSE occurrence with the newly enabled low power mode 
of the VHF antenna (currently in test mode with succesfull measurements on June 1st). This would cover the 
possible rocket-launch days not included in present campaign, its operation will be in principle during 
working hours.
