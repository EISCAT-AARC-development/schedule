notes
For August, I am requesting six intervals for Cluster, four of which are 
outside working hours.  I also include my impression of the priority order, 
which EISCAT can use as a guide if only a smaller number of runs are possible.

The intervals (in priority order) are

August 24  21-01 UT (25th)
August 12  22-02 UT (13th)
August 14  10-14 UT
August 5   22-02 UT (6th)
August 31  20-24 UT
August 26  08-12 UT

For the runs of August 12 and 14th, no VHF is available, so I am requesting two-
dish ESR + UHF.  Generally I would prefer tau1 on the VHF plus LowElNorth on 
the ESR 32m dish interleaved (1:1) with field-aligned operations.

If only one radar is available for the nightside runs, then it is imperative 
that the region between ESR and Tromso be covered, i.e. if only the ESR is 
available then a southward-looking geometry is needed.  If only the mainland is 
available, then a northward-looking mode can be used.

On those occasions when the VHF is unavailable, tau3 on the UHF is the 
preferred option (especially if the new tau3, optimised for better statistics 
at far ranges, is available).
