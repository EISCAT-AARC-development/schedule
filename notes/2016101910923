notes
Russian EISCAT/heating campaign (AARI_HFOX) is planned from 19 to 30 October 
2016 (except of 27 and 28 October). Experiments will be carried out from 12 to 
15 UT under quiet magnetic conditions. The experiments will to be cancelled due 
to unsuitable ionospheric conditions. We will continue to study phenomena in 
the F-region of the ionosphere (plasma parameters, HF-induced plasma and ion 
lines, artificial field-aligned irregularities, narrowband SEE spectral 
components) induced by powerful O/X-polarized HF pump waves. The determination 
and comparison of the ERP thresholds needed to generate various O/X-mode HF-
induced phenomena is planned. Under suitable background geophysical conditions 
it is also planned to carry out X-mode experiments under frequency stepping the 
heater frequency near the fourth electron gyro harmonic frequency.
