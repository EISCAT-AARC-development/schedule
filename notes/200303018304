notes
This experiment is an attempt to use the heater as a magnetospheric radar, using long Barker-coded modulations and receiving equipment deployed by the University of Lancaster.  Quiet conditions are required, with critical frequencies less than 4 MHz.  Shoudl such conditions not be obtained, some of the slots booked for this experiment could be used for the turbulence and aurora studies.
