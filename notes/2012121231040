notes
Radar time is requested to support of a variety of ground-based optical
auroral studies, including:
- Investigating different electron precipitation proxies for use in
atmospheric modelling.
- Validating methods for finding the peak height of the aurora for use
in large statistical studies.
- Developing methods for inverting optical data to give energy and flux
of precipitation.

Electron density measurements with high altitude resolution in the E
region are required, when there are clear skies and aurora over
Kilpisjärvi or Abisko.
