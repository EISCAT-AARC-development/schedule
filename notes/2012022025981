notes
We will continue studies of phenomena in the F-region of the ionosphere induced 
by powerful HF radio waves with X-mode polarisation when the heater frequency 
is above the critical frequency of the F2 layer under different direction of 
the HF beam. 
Behavior of plasma parameters, artificial  small-scale field-aligned 
irregularities, and optical emissions  will be studied. Optical measurements 
will be carried out by the Lancaster University (UK). Experiments will be 
carried out from 16 February to 27 February every day from 13 to 18 UT by using 
the HF heating facility (HEA) and Tromso UHF radar (TRO). The experiments to be 
cancelled due to unsuitable ionospheric conditions or can be moved on earlier 
or later hours.
