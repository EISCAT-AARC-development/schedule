notes
This is the VHF part of the artificial Langmuir turbulence and aurora experiment, see the notes for the UHF part.

Although a four-hour run has been requested, this will be followed by a two-hour run requested by France (FR-AURORA), from 2030-2230, using the same modulation to constitute a six-hour continuous VHF run in compliance with the rules.
