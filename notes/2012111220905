notes
We plan to search for enhanced ion acoustic lines at high altitude 
using the eiscat Svalbard radar. Simultaneously, we shall be monitoring 
the ionospheric conditions at the footpoint of the same field-line using 
the eiscat uhf radar and observe auroral emissions with the cameras of 
the Auroral Large Imaging System (alis). In this way we aim at an increased 
understanding of plasma processes taking place in the auroral
acceleration region.
