notes
Heating for Langmuir turbulence and possibly other
related experiments (e.g. SEE measurements with spectrum analyser),
and CUTLASS if possible.
This experiment is overbooked so that some runs will be cancelled,
13 June and 23 June are strong candidates to be cancelled.
07-09 VHF will probably be d-layer, to cover the 6 hour minimum.
