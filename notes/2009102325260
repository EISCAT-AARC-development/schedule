notes
The major objective of this experiment is measurement of the poleward
traveling ionospheric disturbances (TID) in association with geomagnetic
activity located at the equator side of ESR.

The 42m and 32m antennae are run with the ipy pulse scheme.
The 32m dish is scanned in the magnetic meridian plane.
