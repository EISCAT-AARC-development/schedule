Rob suggests covering two satellite passes in September.  The first is a THEMIS 
magnetopause crossing around 09:30 on September 22nd, with footprint close to 
the ESR.  He also suggests covering one of the four ARTEMIS tail passes which 
are September 16th (16-20 UT), 18th (19-23 UT), 21st (17-21 UT) and 23rd (21-01 
UT).

I have requested the pass on the 18th, since the MLT is such that EISCAT will be 
nicely in the midnight sector, and hence best positioned for the study of tail 
processes.

Radar modes should be the same as normal for AA experiments, with VHF on 
boresight at 30 degrees elevation and the ESR 32m in LowElNorth mode with 4:1 
interleaving or similar between the two dishes (32m:42m).
