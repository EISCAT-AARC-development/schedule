notes
Radar, radio, and optical observations of naturally-enhanced emissions (ion-acoustic, Langmuir, radio, and 
optical waves) conducted near local midnight, in the cusp period, and/or during satellite passes.  ISR data 
will be recorded using 32-m vertical and 42-m field-aligned simultaneously, using both IL and PL channels 
on both antennas.  A new control program will be used for this purpose.  Radio emission data will be 
recorded using a wide-band (0-10 MHz) receiver provided by Dartmouth College operating at the KHO. 
Optical data will be recorded by collaborating instruments on Svalbard.  In this case RELEC is expected to 
pass the ESR near field-aligned between Mon 20141201 and Sun 20141207 between 10 and 12 UT.  We 
are cooperating with the CAPER observations.
