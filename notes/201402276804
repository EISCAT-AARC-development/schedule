notes
We plan to search for enhanced ion acoustic lines at high altitude 
using the Eiscat heating facility. Simultaneously, we shall be monitoring 
the ionospheric conditions using the Eiscat uhf radar and observe auroral 
emissions with the cameras of the Auroral Large Imaging System (Alis). 
Tristatic vhf measurements will be conducted to provide further information 
about the auroral conditions.
