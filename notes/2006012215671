notes
Re-connection rate campaign: We are going to take advantage of having the beams 
of VHF, UHF and ESR-32 m pointing across cusp and night-time auroral 
boundaries, to investigate temporal and spatial variability in the reconnection 
rate. We will use the combination of optics and CUTLASS as larger-scale 
monitoring of the open-closed boundary location and orientation.
