notes
The purpose of this experiment is to study the day and nightside ionosphere. 
Particular areas of interest are signatures of poleward moving forms, polar 
cap patches, and flow channels. This experiment also provides training to 
students taking the AGF-304 radar course at UNIS. We plan to use both 
antennas, and depending on the geophysical conditions at the time, we will use 
different pulse codes (e.g. tau0 and taro) and a combination of fixed 
positions one day, and azimuth and elevation scans the next day. We may 
also use the SPEAR heating facility for part of the run. The purpose is to 
show the students different ways of operating the radar, and collect data that 
they can use for GUISDAP analysis, project work and thesis work.
