notes
The Heater will run O mode field aligned on continuously to generate F- region
artificial irregularities for the CUTLASS radars.
This experiment is run in conjunction with the POUCH experiment at the ESR.

This will be the 1st ever joint heating experiment using the Tromso heater, UHF,
SPEAR and the ESR.  
The purpose of the experiment is to use both heaters in O mode polarisation to
generate F-region artificial density irregularities which will act as targets
for the CUTLASS radars.  The Heaters will be on continuously and it is hoped we
will observe naturally occurring small scale ULF waves in the backscatter.  The
two heated patches will hopefully be either side of the OCFLB.
The UHF and ESR will provide data as to the plasma environment in the
ionospheric interaction region.
The footprint of the Polar spacecraft will pass through both heater patches
allowing simulatanous measurements of the magnetospheric particle populations
thought to be providing energy to the ULF waves.
