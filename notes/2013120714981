This experiment aims at examining variations of the temperature between 80 and
110 km due to aurora effect (from above) and atmospheric wave effect (from
below). Clear sky and aurora activity are desired. UHF mode will be  CP-2
mode-like, but scan pattern will be different from standard ones. VHF mode will
be vertical mode (CP6-like). Collaborations of Japan and Norway.
