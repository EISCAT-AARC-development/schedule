notes
The project is part of a cooperation between UNIS and Univ Bergen (both part of
the Birkeland Center for Space Science). We plan to focus our experiments on the
study of ion outflow in the cusp region. We plan to utilize the ionospheric
profiles derived from the ESR in to compare with previous studies which have
utilized Cluster data. 
The campaign is scheduled to coincide with times when the sun is 8 degrees below
the horizon to allow complimentary measurements from optical instruments at the
Kjell Henriksen Observatory.
We will use the ESR in a field aligned mode using the beata experiment. We have
over-scheduled experiments with a view to cancelling if optical conditions are
poor or geomagnetic conditions too active. 
We will also utilize this time to introduce 2 PhD students from the Belgian
Institute of Aeronomy, Brussels and the Department of Geoscience at Oslo
University to the EISCAT system and it’s capabilities.
If optical conditions are unsuitable during all daytime runs then we have
scheduled a nightside run to extend the study to possible ion outflow associated
with nighside auroral processes.
