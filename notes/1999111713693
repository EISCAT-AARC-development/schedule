API (artificial periodic irregularity) experiment, together with 
meteor trail detection, using dynasonde together with a few (like 4) 
of the Heater transmitters during the Leonids meteor shower.  
Coordinated with similar measurements using HAARP. 
Collaboration or coordination with EISCAT radar experiments anticipated. 
Maximum of 30 hours HF will be run. 
GE(30) or GE(15), depending on results of discussions with SW.
