notes
We aim at optical and radar tomography experiments together with a Japanese
group. VHF will be run vertically unless UHF will be available. Radar runs will
be supported by optical measurements with MIRACLE, ALIS and NIPR cameras.
Finland contributes to this campaign by 10 hours of radar time during the time
period of 21-28 Feb, 2014
