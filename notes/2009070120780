notes
An ionospheric heating experiment which requires simultaneous Heater, UHF radar
operation. The Heater will be pointed 12 deg. South. Depending on the
ionosphere, the pump frequency should be just at the critical frequency of F
region. The UHF will scan in 1 deg. steps either north-south in order to confirm
the temperature and density structure.
