notes
Wide-Latitude Substorm Dynamics 
     These are 'floating' days, the exact operation dates to be selected about one month before based on available 
     predictions. Modes with temporal resolutions better than 5 minutes should be used since we need to address substorm 
     phenomena with better time resolution.

   SPARC 
     SPARC brings together researchers in upper atmospheric and space physics from around the world, providing them a 
     set of online collaboration tools and workspaces that link together scientific instruments, data, and models. The 
     collaboratory is itself a subject of study by computer and behavioral scientists who are developing and refining the 
     tools and organizational structures that will make such real-time, online collaborative research commonplace.
