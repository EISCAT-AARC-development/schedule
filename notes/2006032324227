notes
March 2006 is the optimum month for the sixth campaign of Cluster cusp 
conjunctions. The plane of the Cluster orbit is once again close to the Sun-
Earth line, and a number of magnetopause crossings occur close to EISCAT in the 
morning sector.  One issue affecting EISCAT/Cluster coverage in this month is 
that the ESR and UHF radars are scheduled for a month-long Common Programme 
(CP1) operation (March 6th to April 6th inclusive).  This means that four of 
our five requests are for VHF experiments only.  The other request (March 4th: 
08-12 UT) falls before the start of the Common Programme, and for this we 
request both the ESR and VF radars.  This period should be counted as the 
highest priority.

The specific intervals for which we are requesting coverage are as follows:

March 4th: 08-12 UT  (ESR+VHF) Outbound magnetopause crossing shortly before 12 
UT.

March 8th: 20-24 UT  (VHF) Auroral zone perigee pass

March 11th: 09-13 UT (VHF) Outbound magnetopause crossing aroud 14 UT

March 16th: 07-11 UT (VHF) Outbound magnetopause crossing around 08 UT

March 23rd: 08-12 UT (VHF) Outbound magnetopause crossing around 12 UT.

Of course not all of these intervals correspond to the nominal times at which 
the ESR would be observing the cusp, but actual magnetopause timings will 
depend on solar wind conditions, and could vary by an hour or more.
