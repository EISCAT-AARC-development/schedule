notes
This is tentatively put in for all three sites, as I don't know yet in which    
order the company would like to do the job. They are most likely to start with   
Sodankyl%E4, as they are located in southern Finland and will have to travel north   
in any case.    
   
As soon as I get an agreement with them we can block out the time per antenna   
instead.
