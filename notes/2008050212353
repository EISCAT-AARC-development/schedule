notes
During May, the apogee of the Cluster orbit continues to evolve toward the dawn 
sector.  Some cusp conjunctions might still be possible at the beginning of the 
month, though by the end of the month the orbit plane will be more or less 
orthogonal to the Sun-Earth line.  The THEMIS orbit plane is also close to 
orthogonal to the Sun-Earth line, with THEMIS apogee in the dusk sector. This 
month I have chosen only two conjunctions, the first of which may be one of the 
last cusp conjunctions of the 2008 season, while the second on the 21st is the 
first of the potential flank crossings in the Svalbard sector.  The two 
conjunctions are:

May 2nd 0500-1000

May 21st 0400-1000

As usual the best modes are tau1 with boresight pointing on the VHF, and 
LowElNorth (tau0) on the ESR with 4:1 interleaving between the 32m and 42m 
dishes.
