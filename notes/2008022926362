notes
This request is for a combined UHF/VHF experiment to monitor the impact of 
coronal holes on the terrestrial upper atmosphere.  Results will also be used 
from the ESR, assuming that it is operating in field-aligned IPY mode.  The 
radars will run continuously for 30 hours within a 48 hour window from 00 UT on 
Februay 28th to 24 UT on February 29th.  The precise start of the run will 
depend on solar surface features and cannot be predicted with complete 
precision as yet (January 10).  For most of the time, the UHF will run in low-
elevation northward-looking mode, with the VHF observing vertically in a D-
region mode.  However, one four hour period (nominally 19-23 UT on either 
February 28 or February 29) will use all three UHF sites in a tristatic CP1 
mode. I have called this mode SOLD_TRI to distinguish it from the monostatic 
UHF mode.
