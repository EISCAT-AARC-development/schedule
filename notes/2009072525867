notes
The HF facility will be used in radar mode (possibly in conjunction with the
Dynasonde) to make partial-reflection measurements of the D-region. The facility
will be operated on 5.4 MHz with the receiving array phased for zenithal pointing.

It is hoped that this experiment may be run simultaneously with the PMSE
experiment, sharing the HF facility.

Cancellation is likely due to over-scheduling, but the experiment is within
working hours and it is envisaged that the PMSE experiment will run during the
times that this experiment is not.
