notes
As with the January campaign, this is a block booking, intended to cover a 
number of potential experiments in a radar/optical campaign during the February 
dark-moon period.  Although the Sun is still below the horizon, there will be 
too much scattered light for observations in the cusp sector, so observations 
will be made in the midnight and early morning sectors.

As in January, a substantial part of the observations are expected to comprise 
field-aligned observations in conjunction with the EASI interferometer and the 
ASK imagers, to study small scale auroral structure.  These measurements will 
include the recording of raw sample-level data.   

We are requesting operations to cover the whole "no moon" period and, in 
addition to the UK hours, we are anticipating possible contributions from Norway 
and Sweden.  If these contributions do not materialise then there will be 
cancellations.  Because clear skies are required, weather-related cancellations 
are also a possibility, and would be made within the normal rules.
