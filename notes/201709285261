notes
This is the unusual experiment. It WILL BE ONLY RUN if conditions are suitable 
for PMWE during high-speed solar wind streams and when PMWE has 
been observed by nearby MST radars  Esrad and Maarsy. 
The VHF radar will run tri-static manda experiment  where Tromso VHF radar is pointed vertically, and K 
and S receivers is pointed to the PMWE height above Tromso.
