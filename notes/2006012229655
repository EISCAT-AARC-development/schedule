notes
The purpose of this experiment is to attempt to produce D-Region optical 
emissions by HF-pumping using the Heater. The latter will transmit both O-mode 
and X-mode with a cycle of 5 min. on / 5 min. off. Pump frequencies of 4.0 MHz 
and 5.4 MHz will (high gain array) will be employed. Optical equipment will be 
employed to detect heater-modulated optical emissions from Na and OH in 
the D-Region.
