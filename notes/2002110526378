notes
Combined GE:SW:UK:FI campaign to examine HF-induced optical emissions and
the associated striations, heating and Langmuir turbulence effects.
New Moon and cloud-free skies required, quiet geomagnetic conditions preferred.
Some cancellation is likely.
GE: 30, SW:14, UK:12, FI:8  = 64 hours
These daytime short runs are to measure the striation altitude extent
with CUTLASS. Any two quiet days would do.
